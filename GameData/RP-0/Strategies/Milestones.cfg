This experimental aircraft managed to push through the immense turbulence of the transsonic region and surpass this impressive milestone. With the rate of progress at this new space program, new milestones are sure to follow.\n\t\tHistorical Information: On October 14th, 1947, US Air Force pilot Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in a Bell X-1 that he nicknamed Glamorous Glennis. The rocket-powered aircraft was dropped from the bomb bay of a B-29 and acheived a speed of Mach 1.06 (361 m/s). The Soviets accomplished the feat in 1948 with a Lavochkin La-176 and the British in 1948 with a de Havilland DH.108.

Hopefully your space program will be peaceful and ethical, unlike the V-2.

This will go down in the history books, and it is surely only the beginning of space efforts.\n\t\tHistorical Information: The first satellite to orbit the Earth was Sputnik, launched by the USSR on the fourth of October, 1957. It broadcast a steady radio beep as it orbited, before its batteries ran out. It stayed up for two months before drag from what little atmosphere there was up there deorbited it. This startled the US and started the Space Race.

	headline = RADIATION BELTS DISCOVERED BY NEW SATELLITE!
	article = \t\tThe first space probe to include equipment for measuring cosmic rays, which has revealed belts of charged particles, has orbited around the Earth. This satellite's orbit has it not steadily circling right above us, but instead shooting up to an altitude of more than a thousand kilometers before slowly coming closer and speeding up and then soaring back out. Due to the strange nature of orbital mechanics, this elaborate ballet requires no energy expenditure once the orbit is reached, slowing down and speeding up purely from the laws of nature that Newton discovered almost 300 years ago\n\t\tHistorical Information: Explorer 1, launched by the USAF on 31 February, 1958, was the first scientific satellite. Dr. James Van Allen was in charge of the scientific instrumentation for the satellite, and so the radiation belts it discovered were named after him. Your rocket may or may not actually be following Newton's laws, as the mod "Principia" is required for KSP to accurately simulate N-body gravitational interactions. For new players, the stock two-body approximation is easier to understand.

	headline = ADVANCED MANEUVERING ALLOWS COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE TO HANG STILL IN SPACE
	article = \t\tBy carefully aligning the orbit of the spacecraft to match up with the Earth's rotation, the satellite seems to hang still in space, 35,786 kilometers above us. While staying still may sound easy, this required perfect alignment of the satellite to a very specific orbit, and is the result of months of work by this intrepid space agency. This will allow easy alignment of ground-based communications equipment and, as more are launched, will make possible new forms of communication.\n\t\tHistorical Information: The concept of a geostationary satellite was proposed in 1929, and later popularized by Arthur C. Clarke. The first operational satellite to reach this orbit was Syncom 3, launched by the US on February 14, 1963. Today, geostationary orbits are used for communications, weather, and navigation satellites.

The Moon has long fascinated humanity's curiosity, from the smallest child to the most distinguished astronomer, and with the data received from this probe, our understanding will grow. This will surely be the first of many spacecraft to survey the Moon.\n\t\tLuna 1, launched on 4 January 1959, was the first real life probe to do this, though it was likely intended to impact the Moon. It only got within 5995 kilometers, not enough to complete the contract. It was Luna 2 that achieved this, as well as successfully impacting the Moon.

Humanity has literally touched another world. Anyone who looks up at the Moon can now see it not as something entirely alien, but as the foremost frontier of our exploration into the universe.\n\t\tHistorical Information: The first real probe to do this was Luna 2, launched on 13 September 1959 by the Soviet Union. As well as scientific instruments, it carried two hollow spheres stamped all over with "USSR September 1959" that would break apart on impact, scattering the message across the lunar surface.

	article = \t\tThe <<2>> mission has reached Venus. Sending a probe this far was a great endeavor, and we are now starting to learn about our planetary neighbor. Not too long ago, it was believed that Venus might be a tropical paradise with lush jungles, but this probe corroborates recent telescope findings --- Venus is not a jungle, it is a furnace. The atmosphere is 500 degrees Celsius, well above the melting point of lead. Though it is not pleasant, it is still of scientific interest and this probe has greatly furthered our knowledge.\n\t\tHistorical Information: Venera 1, launched by the Soviet Union in February of 1961, was the first spacecraft to reach Venus, passing within 100,000 km. However, the probe failed due to an overheated solar-direction sensor. The first successful mission to Venus was Mariner 2, launched by the US in August of 1962 and arriving on 14 December, 1962. That is what gave that 500 degree number, as well as revealing Venus's lack of magnetic field, providing info about the content of interplanetary space, and doing some early research on solar wind.

Though they surely would have wished for the program to continue, there are many now questioning if space travel is worth the risk. This accident was surely preventable. All of the engineers and scientists at the program have taken a short break to mourn, but when they return to work on new satellites and new missions it will be with heavy hearts.\n\t\tIn memory of: Valentin Bondarenko, Theodore Freeman, Elliot See, Charles Bassett, Virgil "Gus" Grissom, Ed White, Roger Chaffee, Vladimir Komarov, Clifton C.

	description = Arguably one of the most important milestones a space program can achieve is putting a human into orbit around the Earth. The task requires a reliable launch system and many hours of research and engineering to pull off. Before commiting to the goal, ensure you have the time to research, design, and build a craft capable of putting a human into a 150km orbit for at least one full orbit; there is a hard deadline and the penalties for failure are steep. Single-person orbital spacecraft are fairly rare in history but serve an important role in proving future technologies and sending crew to space before rivals, with Mercury (1962, Atlas LV-3B) and Vostok (1961, Vostok-K) being the only examples.&br;&br;<b><color=red>NOTE: Completing this contract will cause 'Experimental rocketplanes', 'X-Planes High' and 'Suborbital Flight (Crewed)' contracts to become unavailable. If any of those contracts are accepted then they will automatically fail.</color></b>

	synopsis = Send a person into orbit and return safely

	description = Mounted at the end of this folding boom is the Early Magnetometer, used to measure magnetic fields. Historically, this experiment is based on the ones flown on many early satellite and probe missions.\n\nThe science can be transmitted for full recovery. Level 1 Magnetometer Experiment can gather 25% of Magnetometer Science.

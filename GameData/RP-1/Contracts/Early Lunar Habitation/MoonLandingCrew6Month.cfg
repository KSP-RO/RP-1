	description = <b>Program: Early Lunar Habitation<br>Type: <color=red>CAPSTONE</color></b><br><br>The time has come to prove the capabilities of our lunar infrastructure. Land <b>three</b> crew on the surface for six months, and bring them back home safely

	synopsis = Land a crew of three on the Moon for six months and return them safely to Earth

	completedMessage = Congratulations! We have proved our long-duration, high-capacity lunar habitation designs. This work provides excellent insight into what it takes to live in space for a long time. Perhaps we can stretch it to twelve months?

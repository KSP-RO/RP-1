  title = Indian Ocean Telecommunications - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: First Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Australia is one of the furthest-flung members of the British Commonwealth, positioned in the southern hemisphere, nearly at the antipode of the British Isles. Even in the jet age, it takes a Boeing 707 a grueling 34 hours to make the trip from London to Sydney. We would like to end the isolation of "the land down under", and broadcast live television between Britain and Australia.<br><br>Historical example: Intelsat II series satellites (86kg, Delta-E1).

  notes = A satellite Earth station with a cutting-edge antenna has been built at Carnarvon (Western Australia, Australia) to provide satellite telecom to Australia. A satellite over the Indian Ocean should be able to relay data from Carnarvon to Goonhilly Downs. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.

  synopsis = Provide Indian Ocean two-way telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = Regular telecasts are now possible between Australia and Europe.

			subchange = Change Mars and Venus orbit requirements from relying on maximum periapsis to relying on maximum apoapsis (7 and 1 day highly-elliptical orbits for first and repeatable contracts respectively).

			subchange = Add a popup when the New/Upgrade/Reconstruct LC buttons are clicked without a valid vessel to base the new LC off. The popup describes how to use the functionality first: create the desired LV in the editor first, then click New (or Upgrade or Reconstruct) LC to have an LC tuned to that vessel

			subchange = Show an estimate on the net difference in salary for integrating a vessel, along with its time and its rollout cost and time. Note that this (along with time) is only an estimate and does not reflect efficiency gain over the course of integrating the vessel. This is net difference in salary because idle engineers aren't free, and this salary cost is not added to rollout cost because it is assumed the engineers would otherwise be occupied anyway when rolling out the vessel

			change = Overview
			subchange = Programs is a new way of playing RP-1, where contracts are grouped into overarching Programs. Use the Administration Building to select your starting Program(s) and go from there. You will only have access to the contracts appropriate to your current Program(s), and those contracts will only reward rep (and sometimes Confidence, a new currency). Income comes from your programs' budgets, though you also get a large subsidy (towards salary and other maintenance costs). This subsidy increases year-over-year until the mid-60s, and varies based on your current reputation.
			subchange = The existing VAB/SPH build queues are replaced with Launch Complexes. The player can have any number of launch complexes, and LCs have size, mass and resource limits. The Hangar is a special case of LC.

	description = Commonly called Bennet Radio frequency mass spectrometers, they are only sensitive to charged atoms and molecules since they do not incorporate an ion source. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Historically, these simple experiments were flown on many Aerobee sounding rockets and returned to Earth for study.\n\n<b><color=white>This experiment can only be transmitted for 50% of the science.\n\nYou can store up to 3 results at one time.</color></b>\n\nLevel 1 Mass Spectrometry Experiment. Can gather 25% of Mass Spectrometry Science.

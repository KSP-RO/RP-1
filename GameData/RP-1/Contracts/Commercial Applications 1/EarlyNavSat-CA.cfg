	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications</b><br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>The first Navigation Satellite contract proved that measuring signals from a satellite is an effective method for determining position data on the surface of the Earth.  Expand on this capability to create the first rudimentary satellite-based precision location network.  At least 3 satellites are required to locate a position on a sphere, with a fourth necessary to determine vertical position.  Launch at least 4 more navigation satellites into polar orbits.<br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color><br><br>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / @maxCompletions</b>
	genericDescription = Put a satellite with the required amount of navigation satellite payload into the desired orbit.

	synopsis = Launch a Navigation Satellite for a customer.

	completedMessage = Success! The navigation satellite was launched into the proper orbit.  Precision satellite-based navigation is one step closer to being a reality.

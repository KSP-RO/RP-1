	description = <b>Program: Crewed Orbit<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Arguably one of the most important milestones a space program can achieve is putting a human into orbit around the Earth. The task requires a reliable launch system and many hours of research and engineering to pull off. Before committing to the goal, ensure you have the time to research, design, and build a craft capable of putting a human into a 150 km orbit for at least one full orbit. Single-person orbital spacecraft are fairly rare in history but serve an important role in proving future technologies and sending crew to space before rivals, with Mercury (1962, Atlas LV-3B) and Vostok (1961, Vostok-K) being the only examples.&br;&br;<b><color=yellow>NOTE: Completing this contract will cause the 'Suborbital Flight (Crewed)' contracts to become unavailable. If it is accepted then it will automatically fail.</color></b>

	synopsis = Send a person into orbit and return safely

	completedMessage = Mission success! This is a most historic day, the first human to orbit the Earth has returned home safely!

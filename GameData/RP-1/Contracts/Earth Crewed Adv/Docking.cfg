	description = <b>Program: Advanced Crewed Orbit<br>Type: <color=red>CAPSTONE</color></b><br><br>Perform the first docking between two spacecraft. Historically, this was first done on March 16, 1966 with Gemini 8. Neil Armstrong and David Scott docked to an Agena target vehicle, before a stuck thruster on the Gemini spacecraft caused a near-disaster and the mission was aborted.

	synopsis = Perform the first docking of two vessels in orbit of Earth

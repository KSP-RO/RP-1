	description = The goal and realization of putting three (or more) crew on orbit at the same time begins the era of the space taxi and ready access to LEO. Depending on the politics and economy of the originating nation these craft will either be noted predecessors to later craft or become so ubiquitous and reliable in the role that they are still flying 50 years after their first. These craft should be able to support at least three crew and prove that they can stay in orbit for @/DurationText days. The Soviet Voskhod 1 (1964, 5.3 tons, modified Molniya) and Soyuz (1967, 6.5 tons, Soyuz), and the U.S. Apollo CSM (1968, 14.7 - 21 tons for LEO, Saturn 1B) are examples of these craft.&br;&br;<b>Number of Contracts Completed: $HSFOrbitalLEO3Repeatable_Count</b>
	
	genericDescription = Launch a crewed spacecraft capable of supporting at least three people into orbit for a routine mission for the required number of days and return safely home.

	synopsis = Fly a three-person LEO Orbital mission.

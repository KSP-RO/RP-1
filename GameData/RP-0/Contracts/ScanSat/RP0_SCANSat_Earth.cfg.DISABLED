	description = Create a satellite that can provide images and mapping of Earth. For best results, the orbit should have a high inclination to cover all surface area of the planet. Be sure to look at the information available for each scanner to determine the best altitude to scan.

	synopsis = Perform @/scanReadString1 survey of Earth.

	completedMessage = Mission Success! This mapping survey will be very valuable to the scientists on Earth looking to learn more about the planet.

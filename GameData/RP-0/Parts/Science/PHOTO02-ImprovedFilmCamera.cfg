	description = The Improved Film Camera is used to take photographs of Earth from space. This is a vast improvement over the very basic Early Camera. Historically, these were flown as Spy Satellites under the CORONA/Keyhole name, but for our peaceful RP-1 purposes, these represent the earliest weather satellite photos.

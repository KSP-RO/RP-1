	description = Putting a human into orbit around the Earth is a major milestone in spaceplane development.  Such a spaceplane needs to be capable of both extended operation in space, like traditional spacecraft, but also atmospheric flight at speeds up to 7km/s. The task requires a reliable launch system and many hours of research and engineering to pull off. Before committing to the goal, ensure you have the time to research, design, and build a craft capable of putting a human into a 150 km orbit for at least one full orbit; there is a hard deadline and the penalties for failure are steep. Single-person orbital spaceplanes were not historically built, but a number of concepts were studied and X-20 Dyna-Soar (1966 planned, Titan III) even began construction, paving the way for later more capable vehicles.&br;&br;<b><color=red>NOTE: Unlike capsule missions, this contract requires a horizontal landing on the space center runway.</color> If playing from the Cape, the Space Shuttle runway provided by the RSS-CanaveralHD mod is also a valid landing target.</b>&br;&br;<b>HINT: Launching slightly northwards (if in the Northern Hemisphere) instead of due East will put the launch site back under your track after a small number of orbits, reducing crossrange requirements.</b>&br;&br;<b><color=red>NOTE: Completing this contract will cause the 'Suborbital Spaceplane (Crewed)' contracts to become unavailable. If it is accepted then it will automatically fail.</color></b>

	description = <b>Program: Early Satellites (Heavy)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Just putting an object in orbit is a stunt. Getting valuable scientific data from it is far more impressive.&br;&br;With the data returned from our sounding rockets, interesting radiation has been observed. We need you to send a scientific satellite into an eccentric orbit in order to study this data with more accuracy. Based on the best guesses of our scientists, having an apoapsis over 1500 km with a low periapsis will help us to learn more about the radiation surrounding Earth.&br;&br;<b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains a Cosmic Ray Science experiment (Geiger-Muller Counter or Scintillation Counter) as we will need at least one day's worth of science returned from it. Be sure the mass of the craft is at least 1000 kg.</color></b>&br;&br;Real life examples: Object D (Sputnik 3)

	synopsis = Launch a Scientific Satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth with Cosmic Ray Science Experiments and a mass of at least 1000 kg.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite you sent into orbit has returned extremely valuable data that has proven the existence of the Van Allen Radiation Belts.

		CHANGE
		{
			change = What's Changed
			subchange = Fix an issue where Renovating (as opposed to Modifying) the Hangar would make RP-1 think it had become a Pad-type LC, preventing further planes from being built

		version = 2.0.0.0
		versionKSP = 1.12.3
		CHANGE
		{
			change = Notes
			subchange = This update is entirely incompatible with existing saves; it is SAVE-BREAKING. To prevent accidental save-breaking, it is not offered as an upgrade in CKAN. In order to upgrade to it, either create a new Express install, or uninstall the Express Install and then reinstall it. When given the choice make sure to select the regular RP-1 option, not Legacy RP-1.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			change = Overview
			subchange = Programs is a new way of playing RP-1, where contracts are grouped into overarching Programs. Use the Administration Building to select your starting Program(s) and go from there. You will only have access to the contracts appropriate to your current Program(s), and those contracts will only reward rep (and sometimes Confidence, a new currency). Income comes from your programs' budgets, though you also get a large subsidy (towards salary and other maintenance costs). This subsidy increases year-over-year until the mid-60s, and varies based on your current reputation.
			subchange = The existing VAB/SPH build queues are replaced with Launch Complexes. The player can have any number of launch complexes, and LCs have size, mass and resource limits. The Hangar is a special case of LC.
			subchange = You can now appoint (and fire) certain historic Leaders. These leaders offer bonuses and penalties, and new slots unlock as you advance in your career.
			subchange = For a longer overview, see

			subchange = Training completions now shown in the KCT UI and can be warped to using KCT warpto

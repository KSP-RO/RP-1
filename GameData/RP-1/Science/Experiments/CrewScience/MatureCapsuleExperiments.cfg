	description = To investigate determination of spacecraft attitude in yaw and pitch from measurement of ion flow variations. The recording of ion sensor outputs during pitch and yaw maneuvers will be compared with data obtained from the inertial guidance system and the horizon scanner. Results of the comparison and the astronaut evaluation will form the basis for further development of simple, lightweight orbital attitude determination systems.<b>This experiment can be completed once.

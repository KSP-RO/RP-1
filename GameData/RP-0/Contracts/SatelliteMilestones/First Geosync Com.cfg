{
	name = first_GeosyncCom
	title = First Geosynchronous Communications Satellite
	group = Milestones

	description = A geosynchronous orbit is an orbit around Earth of a satellite with an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period of 23h 56m 4.1s. The synchronization of rotation and orbital period means that, for an observer on Earth's surface, an object in geosynchronous orbit returns to exactly the same position in the sky after a period of one sidereal day. This permits devoted satellite coverage over a limited geographic area. Launching a satellite into inclined, eccentric geosynchronous orbit will help prepare us to launch a communications satellite into proper geostationary orbit.<br>This and the following geostationary contract may be completed simultaneously by a single geostationary satellite.
	synopsis = Launch the first geosynchronous communication satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! We are ready to launch a proper geostationary communications satellites.

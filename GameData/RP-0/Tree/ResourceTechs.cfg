	description = You can now use Aluminum Stringer tanks. Aluminum skin-stringer-frame construction is nothing new to the aerospace industry and is the preferred construction of large aircraft today. Longitudinal stringers are responsible for transferring the aerodynamic loads acting on the skin onto the frame. This method of construction does not have mechanically seperate tanks and frame, but the skin of the tank is only responsible for containing the propellant and is not load-bearing. The first rocket of skin-stringer-frame construction was the Soviet R-5 and has remained a staple of Russian design philosophy since, best exemplified in the very successful R-7 and Proton families.

Al-Cu alloys are not much different from unalloyed aluminum, and using it for skin-stringer construction presents little new challenge. Also known as "Duraluminum", this family of alloys is very strong and easily workable. The most famous use of this construction was in the titanic and powerful S-IC, the first stage of the Saturn V lunar rocket, but it was also used in the early versions of the Shuttle External Tank.

All Al-Li skin-stringer construction was used for the final version of the Shuttle External Tank, the Super Lightweight Tank.

	description = You can now use stir-welded Aluminum-Lithium Alloy Stringer tanks. Friction stir welding uses heat generated by the friction of rotating tool to soften and mechanically intermixes two pieces of metal. It is used for structures which need very high weld strength, and has broad application in the aerospace industry. Completely stir-welding a semi-stringer-constructed tank was first used by SpaceX on their Falcon 1e and then Falcon 9 series of rockets. This unique construction allows for the use of fewer structural components and lighter welds, resulting in both mass and cost reductions especially in high-pressure tanks.

Isogrids and orthogrids are advanced hollowed-out structures milled out of a single block of material that have very high rigidity yet exceptional material and mass savings. The delicate & complex lattices on the panel require very high precision machining and thus such a construction is much more expensive to produce than more standard tanks. Nevertheless, gridded tanks have been utilized by nearly every NASA orbital vehicle since the very first to use gridded aluminum construction: the Thor/Delta and Titan rockets as well as the Agena upper stage.

Ever since the X-33 and Venture Star program of the 1990s was aborted only a few years years before the leaking problems that had killed Venture Star were solved, space companies have been trying to justify the very high cost of composite materials. Although costs continue to drop, the intensive manufacturing process is still very expensive, requiring the wrapping and weaving of hundreds of layers of carbon fiber with resins that are then baked off in massive autoclaves. Currently, the only rocket to use composite materials is the smallsat Electron orbital launcher developed by Rocket Lab.

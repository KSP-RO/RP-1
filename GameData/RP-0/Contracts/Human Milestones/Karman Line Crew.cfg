CONTRACT_TYPE
{
	name = first_KarmanCrewed
	title = Pass the Karman Line (Crewed)
	group = HumanMilestones
	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = The Karman line is the line at which the speed necessary to maintain altitude via lift is the same as the speed required for orbit. It's the traditional dividing line between the atmosphere and space (despite their being nonzero pressure well above it, Earth's atmosphere extends quite far indeed). We want you to send someone above it! Note that once you commit to human spaceflight, you have to follow through: this contract has a deadline, and you'll suffer quite the penalty to your budget and prestige if you don't succeed. Make sure you have time to research everything you'll need!

	synopsis = Pass the Karman Line of 100 km with a crewed craft

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The first person as officially reached space!

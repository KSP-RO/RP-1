{
	name = EarlyNavSat
	title = Operational Polar Navigational Satellite
	group = NavSats

	description = We are ready to begin our first operational navigational network. Thanks to the data provided from our prototypes, we have determined that a high polar orbit, in which a satellite passes above or nearly above both poles of the body being orbited on each revolution, is the optimal orbit for maximum spatial and temporal coverage. We therefore must launch our satellites into an inclination of (or very close to) 90 degrees to the equator. The navigitional satellies will pass over the equator at a different longitude on each of its orbits.	<br><b>The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload to project control after being placed sucessfully in orbit.</b><br>This is a series of 24 contracts, of which @index have been completed.<br>Real life examples: Transit 5-series, Transit-O series, Tsiklon/Zaliv series, Tsikada series, Parus series 
	genericDescription = Put an early navigation satellite into the requested orbit.

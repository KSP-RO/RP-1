	name = first_ComSat2
	title = First Active Communications Satellite
	group = Milestones

	description = Our experimentation with passive communications satellites has been intriguing, but an active communications satellite capable of transmitting a message needs testing too. If we can launch a communications satellite into orbit, we can use it to transmit information to the opposite side of the world. Design and build a basic communications satellite and place it in a high orbit.<br>Real life examples: Courier 1A, 1B

	synopsis = Launch the first active communication satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Although this first attempt was very basic, it is the way of the future. Satellite communications will be how humans communicate across the globe with each other.

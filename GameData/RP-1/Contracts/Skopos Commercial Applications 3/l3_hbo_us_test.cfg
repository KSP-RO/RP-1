  title = (PLACEHOLDER CONTRACT) US Domestic TV Recieve-Only Service - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Many TV studios have expressed interest in using leased domestic satellite communications to distribute TV programs. This will allow TV programs to be produced at a single central studio and be instantly transmitted to dozens of local studios across the country. In order to reduce costs, however, local TV studios will be equipped with very basic 4.5-meter satellite earth stations.<br><br>Historical example: Western Union Westar series satellites (574kg, Delta 2914), RCA Satcom series satellites (868kg, Delta 3914), AT&T Comstar series satellites (1,516 kg, Atlas-Centaur D).

  notes = New TV Recieve-Only (TVRO) satellite earth stations have been constructed at TV studios across the country. These basic stations have no tracking capability, so you will need to aim them at a point in the sky and ensure a satellite is always within their field of view. The TV feed will be provided from leased antennas at the Vernon Valley and Moorepark satellite earth stations. <br><color=orange>Author's note: TVRO stations currently function like any other ground station. This contract is just a placeholder until TVRO support is added.</color>

  synopsis = Provide domestic TV Recieve-Only (TVRO) service for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = TVRO service has proved a massive hit among TV studios, allowing live coverage of news and sports events across the country, and the creation of premium pay television featuring special TV programs created in centralized TV studios and distributed by satellite.

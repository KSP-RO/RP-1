	description = Our scientists are once again requesting a new weather satellite. Please place one into the proper orbit to observe Earth. This contract can be completed up to 6 times.&br;&br;<b><color=red>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color></b>&br;&br;<b><color=white>Removal Condition: Completion of a Second Generation Weather Satellite contract.&br;NOTE: You can not select this contract and the Second Generation Weather Sat contract. If you select the other contract while this is active, this will automatically fail.</color></b>&br;&br;<b>Number of Contracts Completed: $EarlyWeatherSats_Count</b>
	genericDescription = Put a satellite into the requested orbit.

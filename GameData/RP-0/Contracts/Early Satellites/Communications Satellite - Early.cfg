	description = Now that we have tested out the Communications Satellite Technology, there are many uses we have for these Satellites. We have a customer that is requesting a new satellite. Launch a new communications Satellite into the specified orbit.\n\n<b><color=red>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color></b><b><color=white>Removal Condition: Completion of a Commercial Communications Satellite contract</color></b>

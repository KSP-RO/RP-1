	%level = 1
	%techRequired = lunarRangeComms
	%description = Although still using analog transmitters, improvements in miniaturization allow for practical communication out to the moon. Idle power: 0.3 watts. (TL0 consumes 2 watts at idle.) NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.

{
	%level = 2
	%techRequired = digitalComms
	%description = Switching to digital encoding allows for a nearly 16 times increase in bandwidth, and much better sensitivity and lower noise allows for better range. However, the digital encoding equipment is much more power hungry than the simple analog equipment. Idle power: 8 watts. From this tech level on, your vehicles can function as relays. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.

{
	%level = 3
	%techRequired = interplanetaryComms
	%description = Further reductions in noise and improvements in encoding and miniaturization improves performance, allowing for practical communication throughout the inner solar system. However, this results in even more power hungry digital equipment, further increasing idle power draw. Idle power: 19.5 watts. NOTE: You must purchase this upgrade here before you can use it.

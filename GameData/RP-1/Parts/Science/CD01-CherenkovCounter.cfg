	description = The Cherenkov detector is another type of high energy particle detector, using a Cherenkov detector in combination with a scintillation detector to further observe and characterize high-energy gamma rays.  It measures the arrival directions and energies of gamma rays and highly-energetic charged particles from cosmic radiation. This detailed measurement can allow for more detailed analysis of the radiation environments in interplanetary space.

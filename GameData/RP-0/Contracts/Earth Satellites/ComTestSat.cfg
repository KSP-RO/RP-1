Launch a new communications test satellite into the proper orbit. &br;&br;<b><color=red>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color></b>&br;&br;<b><color=white>Removal Condition: Completion of a Communications Satellite (Early) contract</color></b>&br;&br;<b>The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.&br;<b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @expectedDays<br>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / unlimited</b>

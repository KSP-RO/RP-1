	description = <b>Program: Crewed Spaceplane Development<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Crewed suborbital flights are used as a safer prelude to an orbital mission, for research, or to set non-orbital altitude records. Send any number of crew above @VesselGroup/ReachAlt/minAltitude meters and land on the runway to satisfy the requirements of this mission. Historical missions used the X-15 (1963, B-52), and SpaceShipOne (2004, White Knight).<b><color=white>NOTE: You can not select this contract and 'First Orbital Spaceplane Flight', 'X-Planes (Suborbital)', or 'Suborbital Flight (Crewed)' at the same time. If you select the other contract while this is active, this will automatically fail.</color></b>&br;&br;<b><color=yellow>NOTE: This contract requires a horizontal landing on the space center runway.</color> If playing from the Cape, the Space Shuttle runway provided by the RSS-CanaveralHD mod is also a valid landing target.</b>&br;&br;<b>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / @maxCompletions</b>
	
	genericDescription = Launch a crewed spaceplane with at least one person aboard above the required height and return safely home to a runway landing.

	synopsis = Send a crewed spaceplane on a suborbital flight

	description = Now that we have put an object in space, we need to demonstrate our ability to start making use of it. A heavier demonstration of our orbital lift capacity to a more advanced orbit will impress the world and open the gate to development of useful satellites with applications such as navigation and communications.<br>Contract completion is required for development of heavier meteorological, communications and navigational satellites.<br>Real life examples: Sputnik 2.

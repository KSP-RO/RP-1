    biomeMask = 0
    description = Very little is known about how liquids behave in a microgravity environment. Various tests are needed to analyze the liquids to properly design fluid storage tanks in the future. <b>NOTE: Experiment takes 2 hours of Crew Observations to complete</b>

    RESULTS
    {
        default = The liquids stay together from surface tension and they can be moved around using thrusters.

{
    id = RP0-FlightControl
    title = Flight Control Experiments
    baseValue = 5
    scienceCap = 10
    dataScale = 5
    requireAtmosphere = False
    situationMask = 16
    biomeMask = 0
    description = Maneuvering in space will be very important if we want to continue our exploration. We need the crew member to see how the spacecraft reacts and maneuvers with yaw, pitch and roll controls. <b>This experiment can be completed twice. NOTE: Experiment takes 1 hour of Crew Observations to complete</b>
    mass = 0.001
    techRequired = basicCapsules
    cost = 0
    tags = basicCapsule
    minCrew = 1
    celestialBodies = Earth
    requiredResources = CrewTime,60
    situations = ORBITING
    RESULTS
    {
        default = The craft responds to the pilot's maneuvering.

    baseValue = 8
    scienceCap = 16
    dataScale = 5
    requireAtmosphere = False
    situationMask = 16
    biomeMask = 0
    description = This experiment is designed to test how well humans can track objects in space. A multicolor, mylar balloon, about the size of a beach ball, will be extended on a tether for the crew member to track. <b>This experiment can be completed twice. NOTE: Experiment takes 2 hours of Crew Observations to complete</b>
    mass = 0.003

    requiredResources = CrewTime,120
    situations = ORBITING
    RESULTS
    {
        default = The crewmember can see the brightly colored balloon outside of the window.
    }

    id = RP0-EarthPhotography
    title = Earth Photography
    baseValue = 5
    scienceCap = 20
    dataScale = 5
    requireAtmosphere = False
    situationMask = 16
    biomeMask = 0
    description = By using a hand-held camera, our crew can take images of locations on Earth that our scientists are intersted in. These images can be of much higher quality than our current satellite technology can accomplish. <b>This experiment can be completed four times. NOTE: Experiment takes 1 hour of Crew Observations to complete</b>
    mass = 0.005
    techRequired = basicCapsules
    cost = 0

    situations = ORBITING
    RESULTS
    {
        default = Images are taken using a hand-held film camera.
    }

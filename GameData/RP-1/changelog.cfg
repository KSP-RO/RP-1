		{
			change = What's Changed
			subchange = Remove Orbital Recovery contract mentioning it can be completed twice
			subchange = Add a patch so that Kerbalism uses the actual inclination of a vessel when checking if an experiment could run (inclination was wrong for vessels not around the current body when Principia is installed due to how Principia implements axial tilt)
			subchange = Add Astronaut Complex upgrade requirements to Early X-Planes and Early Crewed Orbit to signpost that upgrades to the AC will be needed
			subchange = Fix various tips etc. that mention Astronaut Complex levels
			subchange = Fix an issue where UI state could sometimes not be restored properly after closing a popup
			subchange = When building a new LC that does not perfectly share commonality with an existing LC, its commonality percent is capped at 95%. This fixes an issue where LCs could be upgraded bit by bit with no efficiency loss
			subchange = Highlight (in yellow) when the desired max mass for an LC is above the maximum possible modify limit (or below the minimum possible modify limit)
			subchange = Fix an issue where RP-1 would hang on launch if KSPWheel was not installed
			subchange = Fix lingering references to Renovate and Upgrade rather than just Modify for LCs
			subchange = Update Kerbalism patches to match the existing Kerbalism PRs and make sure they will not be applied to forthcoming Kerbalism releases which have the PRs merged
			subchange = Improve the Install Checker's text to be clearer that the issue could be either missing or outdated dependencies when RP-1 doesn't detect its dependencies or itself fails to load
			subchange = Add support for new ROC docking ports
			subchange = Add optional orbit contract to Crewed Lunar program

			subchange = Add some missing costs for some resources RO adds
			subchange = Show an error dialog if Harmony patching fails during KSP startup
			subchange = Move most RF tank costs from the subtank to the base part (i.e. adding a Kerosene tank will not actually increase the cost of the part, since the part is assumed to be a tank already, not an empty shell)

	VERSION
	{
		version = 3.0.0.0
		versionKSP = 1.12.3
		CHANGE
		{
			change = Training and Nauts
			subchange = AC now has 5 levels (base, suborbital, orbital, EVA, lunar). Level properties now explicitly defined in cfg. Upgrading levels is on balance faster than it was before these changes, despite their being more levels. Close #2202 
			subchange = Trainings require the appropriate AC level, courses for parts that are locked due to AC level are highlighted in a different color from courses for researching parts
			subchange = Proficiency training is required for all parts on a vessel (excepting clamp/MLP parts, or things below them in the vessel part hierarchy), and a naut cannot be transferred into, or board, a part for which they do not have proficiency training. As before however, a naut only needs mission training for the part they are placed in at launch
			subchange = General Aviation parts now do require training (a course existed for them, but it was never required, leading to training misunderstandings). It only lasts 1 day however!
			subchange = X-Plane training now depends on General aviation
			subchange = Rework naut upkeep for baseline, when training (and based on training course type!), and when idle
			subchange = Fix some bugs around crew training
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			change = Science
			subchange = Remove RnD upgrades and researcher caps. Instead, researchers cost a bit more per year in salary, and base research rate is a bit slower. Close #2075
			subchange = Science earned above 30 now increases researcher efficiency, and this efficiency is split out from efficiency from electronics bluesky nodes and both are shown on the tooltip for the Available Science widget
			subchange = Staged (ORSC and FRSC) and hydrolox tech nodes depend on the previous level of generic Rocketry node
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			change = General Balance
			subchange = You can no longer directly add ComSatPayload or NavSatPayload to ServiceModule tanks. Instead use the specific Com Sat and Nav Sat parts. See RP-1 Contract Satellites
			subchange = Lower some program funding mid-lategame to balance no more RnD upgrades
			subchange = Integration pauses while any rollouts, rollbacks, airlaunch mounts/unmounts, or recoveries are in progress. Reconditioning can still occur during integration, however. Engineering resources are apportioned between these blocking projects based on their total time requirements (i.e. build points)--not their current time remaining. This means that if all projects are started at the same time they'll all finish at the same time, but if some projects are started later, the earlier-started projects will still complete earlier.
			subchange = Lowered starting LC efficiency cap slightly, rejiggered some efficiency increases
			subchange = Changed the formula by which part effective cost is converted to build points, changing the time it takes to integrate vessels
			subchange = Confidence gained from science and from contract rep now uses input science and rep, respectively, not leader-modified science/rep
			subchange = Sounding rocket programs now have mildly backloaded funding
			subchange = Increased 4.5Mm contract to 5Mm downrange distance
			subchange = Engines and tanks now support dynamic tags, and BP cost will be increased for engines that use cryogenic, toxic, or both-cryogenic-and-toxic propellants
			subchange = Engine costs are now standardized using a formula for uniformity (with some hand-tuning when necessary), broadly equivalent to historical costs when available
			subchange = Added difficulty settings to change build rate and research rate, increased them to 1.5 at Easy and 1.2x at Normal
			subchange = Tweak the Crewed Lunar funding curve so the funding starts higher and ramps up faster
			subchange = Allow only EC to be added inside procedural avionics.
			subchange = Includes a redone & completed version of the abandoned #2069 featuring a new camera part and experiment
			subchange = Rollout and airlaunch costs are halved
			subchange = ROTanks interstage/decouplers (Hollow Interstage e.g.) now use ProcFairings rules for mass and cost
			subchange = Hypersonic Flight experiment is now a flying-low experiment
			subchange = Remove flyby requirements for first Mars and Venus orbit
			subchange = Procedural avionics now get 10 sample slots
			subchange = Fix broken buttons on new/modify LC dialog
			subchange = Remove Renovate/Upgrade distinction for LCs, there's now just Modify
			subchange = Fix engine refurbishment not working (engines had been treated as if they had not run when recovering vessels)
			subchange = Add missing applicants for Direct Ascent lunar landing
			subchange = RP-1's Collect Science contract parameter now distinguishes between the globally-required fraction complete for an experiment (i.e. x% of all the experiment's science in a given situation must be completed) and the fraction that must be completed per biome for that biome to count as completed
			subchange = Fix a number of broken leaders
			subchange = Structural proc parts now have the same upgrade chain as fairing sides
			subchange = ModuleRCS no longer allows cheating to get around axial control locks via either MechJeb or fore-by-throttle
			subchange = Show efficiency used when displaying integration/rollout time in the editor
			subchange = Fix an issue where leaders would stay retired on revert if they retired during a sim
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			change = Misc
			subchange = Patch Kerbalism to better calculate solar panel exposure at high warp
			subchange = Added gameplay tips around training (warning to hire & train nauts on accepting a crewed program, warning when trying to launch a crewed vessel with no nauts even training for it, popup when naut fails to board a part, highlight and 'semi-valid' (as if full) color for untrained parts when Crew Transfer is up
			subchange = Non-upgradeable buildings now get the average visual look of the space center
			subchange = Most RP-1 popups now hide the RP-1 and the Space Center Management (KCT) windows so that the popup can be seen (this is because the popups use the new GUI system introduced in KSP 1.0, and the other UIs use the old IMGUI system from before then, so the latter always render on top)
			subchange = Show program slot cost on program card in Programs list in admin building
			subchange = Patch KSPWheel to attempt to fix an issue where wheels could get damaged for no apparent reason
			subchange = EC rates are now displayed in Watts throughout Kerbalism displays
			subchange = Attempt to catch issues when warping to funds when funds increase for only a short time and then decrease
			subchange = Grammar tweaks - MagScan and Visible Imaging
			subchange = Many backend improvements, refactors, and changes to ease maintenance

			subchange = No longer depend on MagiCore
			subchange = Experiments will show Invalid Situation rather than Waiting when used landed/splashed/flying low (under 40km) on Earth
			subchange = Speculative fix to vessel integration breaking if the Switch Editor (VAB<->SPH) button is used

			subchange = Prevent tourists, sorry Test Animals, from being able to do crew science

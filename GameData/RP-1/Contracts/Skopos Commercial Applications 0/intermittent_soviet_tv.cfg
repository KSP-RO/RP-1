  // Mostly pilfered from NASA TM X-70435 p. 11-1.
  description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>For the Soviet Union, which occupies about one-sixth of the earth’s surface, an efficient system of space communications is a vital necessity. The country covers nearly 11,000 km from east to west and over 7,200 km from north to south, and is crossed by 11 time zones; in addition, there are tremendously varied climatic conditions and vast areas of rugged terrain.<br><br>Historical example: Molniya 1-1 (1,600kg, Molniya).

  synopsis = Provide two-way television for three months with 1% availability (~15 min per day) between Moscow (Moscow Oblast, USSR) and Vladivostok (Primorsky Krai, USSR). Open the Skopos window (pink wave) to view the current connection status.

  notes = Earth stations with large tracking antennas have been built in Moscow and Vladivostok. Open the Skopos window (pink wave) in the tracking station and select the "show network" button to view their location.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a space communications network for the Soviet Union, paving the way for an operational system. Maintain this connection for one year for further testing.

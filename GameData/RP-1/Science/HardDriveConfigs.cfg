// samples - sample slots. this one is counter-intuitive, as most experiments
// occupy multiple slots per run. Slot size is tied to data scales in kerbalism's
// back-end, and samples have large data values for lab analysis purposes.

// Change values here, they'll get copied and patched later in this file.
// Anything that modifies tech tree positions

	description = The Scintillation Counter Cosmic Ray Telescope is a combination of three scintillators giving both the energy (E) of a charged particle and its rate of energy loss (dE/dx) in the scintillators. It is measuring the mass and energy spectra of primary and solar cosmic rays and electrons.\n\nLevel 2 Cosmic Ray Experiment Device. Can gather 100% of Cosmic Ray Science.

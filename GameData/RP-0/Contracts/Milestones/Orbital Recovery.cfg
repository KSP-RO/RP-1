	description = Reentry is brutally hot and dangerous. However, it can be survivable with the right technology and equipment. We want you to design, build, and launch a craft that can survive a reentry and make a soft landing or splashdown on Earth. Note that orbital-speed suborbital flights are acceptable as well. You may complete this contract up to three times.	
		
	synopsis = Recover a craft from an orbital-velocity descent	
		
	completedMessage = Congratulations! The craft has survived reentry, and engineers are examining it very keenly indeed.

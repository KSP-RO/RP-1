	title = Prototype Navigational Satellite
	description = Our first navigational satellite was a valuable test run that has given us the experience to begin developing an operational navigations system. However, we are not yet ready to build our first mature navigational system. We need to determine the optimal orbit that will provide a balance between ground coverage, visibility, and launch accessability. Design and launch some test articles while we develop a useful series of navigational satellites.<br><b>The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload to testing control after being placed sucessfully in orbit.</b><br>This contract may be repeated twice. Currently @index have been completed.<br>Real life examples: Transit 4-series
	genericDescription = Put a prototype navigation satellite into the requested test orbit.
	synopsis = Launch a prototype navigational satellite into the proper orbit
	completedMessage = Success! We are getting more Doppler curves to refine our navigation algorithms and orbit decisions.

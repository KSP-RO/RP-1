	title = Break Mach @mach (crewed)
	description = Design, build and fly a crewed aircraft or rocket to attain @targetSpeed meters per second and hold above it for 60 seconds. Vital to the development of new wing shapes and high-speed aerodynamics (the area rule, swept wings, mach tuck, and so on), breaching the sound barrier is a worthy scientific endeavor. Firsts to break the sound barrier include the U.S. Bell X-1 (1947), the Soviet Lavochkin La-176 (1948), and the British de Havilland DH.108 (1948).
	genericTitle = Crewed Mach Record

	synopsis = Fly a crewed craft to reach @targetSpeed m/s and maintain for at least 60 seconds.
	completedMessage = Congratulations! You've set a new altitude record!

	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Taking photographic images from space, with a powerful enough lens, can provide highly detailed information about many things. When used for intelligence purposes, an eye in the sky is an invaluable tool for gathering information about geopolitical rivals. These types of satellites also have numerous peaceful purposes, including crop monitoring, observing deforestation, and providing indicators for areas requiring humanitarian aid. <b><color="yellow">Make sure your craft contains an Basic Film Camera, and a system to return the film for processing. Collection of all available science will require multiple launches due to film storage limitations onboard the vehicle.</color></b><br><br>Real life examples: Discoverer/Keyhole-1 (780kg, Thor-Agena)

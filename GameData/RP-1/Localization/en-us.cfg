		// Leader text
		#rp0_Leaders_Desc_leaderVonBraun = Wernher von Braun designed the V-2 rocket for the Nazis, then moved to America under Operation Paperclip and began working at U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency. After the failure of Vanguard 1, ABMA successfully launched Explorer 1 on a Juno I rocket, derived from the Redstone. ABMA was then transferred to NASA as the Marshall Space Flight Center, and there he was instrumental in designing the Saturn I and V. He was criticized for being too cautious and for possibly committing crimes against humanity, though he was never tried.

		#rp0_Leaders_Desc_leaderRosen = Milton Rosen led the Viking and Vanguard programs for the Naval Research Laboratory before the latter was absorbed into NASA to form the nucleus of the Goddard Space Flight Center. After Vanguard, Rosen became Director of Launch Vehicles and Propulsion for NASA, where he helped lay the groundwork for the Saturn I and V launch vehicles as well as initiating the program that combined the simple upper stage of Vanguard with the Thor booster: Thor-Delta, later Delta.

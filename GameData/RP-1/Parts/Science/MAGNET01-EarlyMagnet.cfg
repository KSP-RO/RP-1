	description = The early magnetometer, used to measure magnetic fields. Though these fields stretch out into space, their study can hint at a planet's core. Experiments like these are also used to study the Sun's magnetic field and how it interacts with planets. Historically, this experiment is based on the ones flown on many early satellite and probe missions.

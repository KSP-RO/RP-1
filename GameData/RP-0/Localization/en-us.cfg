		// Leader text
		#rp0_Leaders_Desc_leaderVonBraun = Wernher von Braun designed the V-2 rocket for the Nazis, then moved to America under Operation Paperclip and began working at U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency. After the failure of Vanguard 1, ABMA successfully launched Explorer 1 on a Juno I rocket, derived from the Redstone. ABMA was then transferred to NASA as the Marshall Space Flight Center, and there he was instrumental in designing the Saturn I and V. He was criticised for being too cautious and for possibly committing crimes against humanity, though he was never tried.

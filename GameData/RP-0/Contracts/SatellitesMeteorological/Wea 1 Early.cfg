	title = Early Weather Satellite
	description = The meteorological satellite that we launched was a good first step to understanding how the upper atmosphere affects the weather. However, our meteorologists want to see images of the clouds to better assess the situtation. To get usable photography, it is required that we have a relatively high and very circular orbit that is moderately inclined. Place our first proper weather satellites into the proper orbit to observe Earth.<br><b>The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload to operational control after being placed sucessfully in orbit.</b><br><b>Make sure your craft carries an early television camera, as we will need science returned.</b><br>This is a series of eight contracts, of which @index have been completed.</b>Real life examples: TIROS 1-8.
	genericDescription = Put a weather satellite into the requested orbit.
	synopsis = Launch a weather satellite with a television camera into the proper orbit
	completedMessage = Success! The images produced have proven that weather satellites can be extremely effective in helping meteorologists predict the weather.

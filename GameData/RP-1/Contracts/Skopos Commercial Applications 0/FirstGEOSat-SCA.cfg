	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Having a communication satellite that remains stationary relative to a satellite earth station means that the antenna wouldn't need to track movements to stay connected, and a constant line of sight can be maintained 24 hours a day. This would greatly simplify communication relay and mass transmission systems.<br><br>See the RP-1 wiki for more information on how to get to a geostationary orbit.<br>Historical example: Syncom 3 (39 kg, Thor-Delta) launched in August of 1964.<b>

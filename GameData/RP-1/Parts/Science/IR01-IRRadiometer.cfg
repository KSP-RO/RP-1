//**********************************************************************************
//Mariner 2 infrared radiometer
//mass: 1.3 kg [1/2]
//power consumption: 2.4 Watts (average?) [1/2].
//2 Bolometers, sensitive at 10.4 and 8.4 microns, with a FoV of ~1.2x1.2 degrees [2]
//Samples were digitized to 213 levels, with each detector being sampled every 20 seconds. One frame
//consisted of 6 subframes. [2] 15 frames were intended to be taken, but issues with scan rate resulted in
//only ~3 full frames being taken of Venus. [3]
//Round 213 levels to 256 levels for an even 8 bits (for diagnostic data, housing temp readings, etc.)
//2 samples * 8 bits / 20 seconds per sample = 0.8 bits/second (low, but Mariner 2 at Venus could only transmit 8 bit/s) [4]

//Each sample would capture ~1/250-500 of Venus, depending on altitude. Say 500 frames for a complete scan of a planet.
//500 frames/~6 biomes per planet * 6 subframes * 2 sensors * 8 bits = 8000 bits

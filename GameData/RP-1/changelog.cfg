Note that this (along with time) is only an estimate and does not reflect efficiency gain over the course of integrating the vessel.

Income comes from your programs' budgets, though you also get a large subsidy (towards salary and other maintenance costs). This subsidy increases year-over-year until the mid-60s, and varies based on your current reputation.

Welcome to Realistic Progression One, the heavyweight career addon for Kerbal Space Program's Realism Overhaul.

RP-1 is a career mode for RealismOverhaul with minimal install requirements, and with fair and balanced gameplay. Our aim is to allow players to enjoy RealismOverhaul in career mode, without installing a huge number of modules on top of those required by RealismOverhaul itself. However we also wish to ensure that RP-1 works with as many additional mods as possible; we use a fresh fully icon rebuilt Tech Tree for the basis of career progression, and try to place as many parts from other mods as possible in a historical fashion.  Right now a good number of nodes lack much in the way of parts allowing for placement of balanced historically appropriate parts in those nodes. 

RP-1 is a community effort, and your contributions are appreciated. You can report issues [on our issues page](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/issues), and access the [source code on github](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/tree/master). 

When starting the game, we recommend "Easy" or "Normal" for players new to RP-1, and "Moderate" or "Hard" settings for experienced players.

RP-1 adds many new features to KSP career mode, including:

Tooling: Tooling costs significantly adjust the play cost of craft. As you adjust tank sizes wait till the end of craft saving to tool the tanks so you do not waste funds. Once you have completed your design, tool your parts to greatly decrease cost and build time in the future.

Maintenance: A small cost of the infrastructure and wage cost is rolled into play. This puts a minimal drag on program growth.

KCT Integration: KCT is heavily integrated and using the RP-0 Settings is important. Make sure you have lower rated launch pads availble and don't just focus on one maximum upgraded pad for all use. This will lower costs and rollout times if you use the smallest pad needed for the craft launched. There are 7 levels of pad and R&D.

Crew Training: Each 'naut needs to be proficient and mission trained to fly on a craft. Proficiency training will end after a time and mission training is good for one mission and is then lost after recovery.

Crew readiness and retirement: After each recovery crew are on leave for a short time. Each crew also has a retirement date that rolls forward after each mission.

Contracts: Many contracts leading through a rough historical path are available. One contract will add a beginning node of parts that are available from the start but you may not want cluttering the VAB/SPH. Parts in this node have a purchase price of 1 fund and this contract will auto-complete seconds after leaving the mission control the first time.

Tech Tree: A massive tree orginized along a historical frame. Two gating tech patchs (Material Science, and Electronics) limit what nodes are available in a general sense. Most nodes have custom icons usually taken from the profile of relavent hardware from the node. Using KCT the nodes will have an orange interior when purchased with points and the normal purchased colors after KCT delay times pass.

Part Tags: launch costs are significanlty affected by the types of systems on the craft. For instance toxic hypergolics require special handling and disposal. So a solid rocket motor driven craft may at first glance seem more expensive but my indeed be less costly due to reduce launch costs.

Engine Variations: Many engine variations are available and purchased via the Engine GUI. In the Tech tree these will appear and may have some variable cost however this cost is not real and purchasing this "Part" will have no cost or impact whether it is purchased when looking in the Engine GUI.

**Requirements:**

*These mods are required for RP-1 to function properly*
- Realism Overhaul and all of its required mods (including Real Solar System)
- Module Manager
- SXT Continued (Needed for engines)
- Contract Configurator (Needed to make more complex RP-1 contracts function)
- Custom Barn Kit
- Ven's Stock Revamp - Core (Needed for engines)
- Ven's Stock Revamp - New Parts (Needed for engines)
- Magicore
- Click Through Blocker
- Toolbar Controller
- Kerbalism (RO Config)
- KSP Community Fixes

**RO-Mods:**

*These mods were created specifically for use with the RO/RP-1 mod suite, and provide high-quality and well-supported parts*
- ROEngines
- ROTanks
- ROCapsules
- ROSolar

**Recommended Mods:**

*These modes are strongly recommended for use with RP-1*
- Atmosphere Autopilot
- B9 Procedural Wings
- Hangar Extender Extended
- Kerbal Alarm Clock
- Kerbal Renamer
- KSCSwitcher
- KSPWheel
- MechJeb2
- Persistent Rotation (RO integrates it's own version of Persistent Rotation, but installing the mod gives you a few more attitude control options)
- Procedural Fairings
- Procedural Parts
- RCS Build Aid
- RealAntennas
- RSSDateTimeFormatter
- Ship Manifest
- TAC Life Support
- Test Flight OR Test Lite (TestFlight has more features and is generally better supported at the moment)
- Toolbar
- Ven's Stock Revamp OR Restock

**Suggested Mods:**

*These mods are suggested for use with RP-1, but may not be fully supported, and are not necessary for the full RP-1 experience*
- Bluedog Design Bureau
- Editor Extensions Redux
- FASA
- HyperEdit
- Internal RCS
- Janitors Closet
- Kerbal Engineer Redux (May causes crashes, and reports slightly inaccurate dV)
- kOS
- NavHUD
- Near Future Construction
- Near Future Electrical (requires manual installation, due to conflict with DBS)
- Near Future Exploration
- Near Future Launch Vehicles
- Near Future Propulsion
- Near Future Solar
- Raidernick's Mods (See Notes [here](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki/Recommended-Extra-Mods#6-the-blacklist-mods-to-avoid))
- SCANSat (See Notes [here](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki/Recommended-Extra-Mods#6-the-blacklist-mods-to-avoid))
- Semi-Saturable Reaction Wheels
- Texture Replacer
- Waypoint Manager

**Incompatble Mods**

*These mods are explicitly incompatible with RP-1, and should never be installed*
- Crowd Sourced Science (RP-1 provides completely new science types. Any stock science mods are incompatible)
- Dynamic Battery Storage (May conflict with Kerbalism, although newer versions should safely disable themselves if a conflict is detected)
- Hide Empty Tech Tree Nodes (RP-1 uses empty tech nodes to act as gates. Hiding them will break the tech tree progression)
- Kerbal Construction Time (RP-1 integrates it's own version of KCT)
- KRASH (RP-1 integrates it's own version of simulations)
- MechJeb and Engineer for all! (RP-1 already grants MechJeb and Kerbal Engineer to all command parts)

Note that more effort has gone into balancing earlier nodes than later nodes. Your feedback and assistance in balancing all nodes is appreciated!

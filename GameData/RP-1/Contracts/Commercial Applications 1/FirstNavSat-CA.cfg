	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>By measuring the Doppler shift of radio signals from a satellite in a known orbit, it is possible for a receiver on the ground to establish their location, which would have many applications both civilian and military. To test the principle and develop receiver equipment, it is necessary to have a test navigational satellite in orbit. <br>Historical example: Transit 1B (119 kg, Thor-Ablestar).<br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color>

	synopsis = Launch the first navigation satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite is in orbit and we have already begun to receive Doppler curves.

Welcome to Realistic Progression One, the heavyweight career addon for Kerbal Space Program's Realism Overhaul.

RP-1 is a career mode for RealismOverhaul with minimal install requirements, and with fair and balanced gameplay. Our aim is to allow players to enjoy RealismOverhaul in career mode, without installing a huge number of modules on top of those required by RealismOverhaul itself. However we also wish to ensure that RP-1 works with as many additional mods as possible; we use a fresh fully icon rebuilt Tech Tree for the basis of career progression, and try to place as many parts from other mods as possible in a historical fashion.  Right now a good number of nodes lack much in the way of parts allowing for placement of balanced historically appropriate parts in those nodes. 

RP-1 is a community effort, and your contributions are appreciated. You can report issues [on our issues page](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/issues), and access the [source code on github](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/tree/master). 

When starting the game, we recommend "Easy" or "Normal" for players new to RP-1, and "Moderate" or "Hard" settings for experienced players.

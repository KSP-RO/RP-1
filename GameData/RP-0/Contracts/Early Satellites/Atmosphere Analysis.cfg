	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = It would be great for all humans if we could find a way to better predict the weather. One of the first steps in this is to understand the properties of the upper atmosphere. Insert a satellite with a Barometer and Thermometer on it to measure the values found. Transmit the science back to the KSC for analysis.\n\nThis could be considered the first "Weather Satellite" and will open up new weather satellite opportunities.

	synopsis = Launch a Satellite to study the upper atmosphere

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The information returned from the satellite has allowed our scientists to make some more accurate predictions of the weather. Our next step is to get a camera into orbit.

  title = Experimental Paris-Moscow Television
  // Mostly pilfered from NASA TM X-70435 p. 11-1.
  description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>As part of a Franco-Soviet agreement on colour television, we are considering using the space segement of the Soviet television network to relay television between Paris and Moscow.<br><br>Historical example: Molniya 1+ series satellites (1,600kg, Molniya).

  synopsis = Provide two-way television for three months with 1% availability (~15 min per day) between Moscow (Moscow Oblast, USSR) and Pleumeur-Bodou (Britanny, France). Open the Skopos window (pink wave) to view the current connection status.

  notes = France has a ground station with a cutting-edge antenna in Brittany, as part of its joint programme with the United States. However, Brittany is quite far West of the Soviet Union; you may need to adjust your designs accordingly. Open the Skopos window (pink wave) in the tracking station and select the "show network" button to view their location.\nThe experimental Paris-Moscow transmissions are mutually exclusive; while you must provide support for both westward and eastward television broadcasts, your satellite does not need to have the capacity for those to happen at the same time.

  completedMessage = Compatibility between French and Soviet satellite telecom systems has been confirmed. Maintain this connection for one year for further testing.

	description = The discovery of the Van Allen Radiation Belts demonstrated that the geography of space is far more complex that most early scientists anticipated. Our original probe's instrumentation was overwhelmed by the strong radiation coming from the belts. We've tuned it a bit better and hope to get better data this time. Launch into an eccentric orbit and survive @missionDuration.</br><b>Make sure your craft can survive in space for several days and contains a Cosmic Ray Science experiment (Geiger-Muller Counter or Scintillation Counter) as we will need science returned.</b><br>Real life examples: Explorer 1, 3, 4, 6, Kosmos 3, 4<br>This is a series of four contracts, of which @index have been completed.
	genericDescription = Launch a scientific satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth with cosmic ray science experiments
		
	synopsis = Launch a scientific satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth with cosmic ray science experiments
		
	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite you sent into orbit has returned valuable data is helping early efforts to map the Van Allen Radiation Belts.

	description = <b>Program: Great Observatories<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Since the launch of the first infrared space telescope, astronomers have clamored for larger observatories. Launch a large infrared space telescope to learn more about various objects' composition.<br><br><b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains an Infrared Space Telescope 2 experiment and produces enough electricity to power it.</color></b><br><br>Historical example: Infrared Space Observatory.

	synopsis = Launch the first large-scale infrared space telescope, and return the first 30 days of science observations.

	completedMessage = Success! Science data returned has already led to the discovery of cosmic dust in the void between galaxies.

	description = Designed to collect data to determine the composition and structure of positive ions and neutral particles in the upper atmosphere of planets and moons as well as the magnetosphere of planets. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Historically, these simple experiments were flown on Earth satellites and interplanetary crafts including the Mars Viking Lander and Cassini.\n\nLevel 3 Mass Spectrometry Experiment. Can gather 75% of Mass Spectrometry Science.

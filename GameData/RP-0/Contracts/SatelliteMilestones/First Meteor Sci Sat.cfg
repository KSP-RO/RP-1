	title = First Meteorological Science Satellite
	group = Milestones

	description = It would be great for all humans if we could find a way to better predict the weather. One of the first steps in this is to understand the properties of the upper atmosphere.<br><b>Make sure your craft contains a thermometer and barometer as we will need science returned.</b><br>Real life examples: Vanguard 1, 2.

	synopsis = Launch a satellite to study the upper atmosphere

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The information returned from the satellite has allowed our scientists to make some more accurate predictions of the weather. Our next step is to get a camera into orbit.

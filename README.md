### INTRODUCTION & INSTALLATION

**What is NQB? NQB (Neph's Quarterly Budgets) does three things:**

  1) Replaces funding contract rewards with reputation rewards. More reputation means you earn more money in your budget, which is paid out four times a year.
  2) Restructures the contract progression to be more historical. This means contract objectives are based off of real rocket contracts and also relative rewards are changed to encourage the player to try more than just the traditionally optimal RP-1 path.
  3) Relies on Kerbalism to make more interesting long-duration science and communications contracts.

**How to install:**

*NOTE: Whenever you install or update a mod, ensure you completely delete and replace the old folder.*

  1) Be on KSP v1.7.3 with a functional RP-1 setup.

  2) Install ROKerbalism w/ Contracts:  
      * https://github.com/Kerbalism/Kerbalism
      * https://github.com/Standecco/ROKerbalism
      * https://github.com/nepphhh/KerbalismContracts

  3) Install Pre-release (Airlaunch) KCT: 
      * hhttps://github.com/linuxgurugamer/KCT/releases/download/1.4.7.8/KerbalConstructionTime-1.7.3-1.4.6.19-173.zip

  4) Update RealismOverhaul (do NOT copy over the MFI folder): 
      * https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul

  5) Install NQB: 
      * https://github.com/nepphhh/RP-0

  6) WARNING!
      * When you start your career, make sure you disable all contract packs besides RP-1 NQB. This is done from the difficulty settings, and may include the SCANSat and KerbalismContracts contract packs.

### CHANGELOGS

**RP-NQB 0.2.3 Changelog:**
  
  BALANCE CHANGES:
  * Increased value of downrange rocket contracts, made the smaller ones a bit less worthwhile.
  * Delinearlization of contracts--contract unlocks are less sequential.
    * Bio SRs are no longer behind First Suborbital Return.
    * X-Plane Altitude is no longer behind Sound Barrier.
  * More early game tweaks.
    * Nerfed mass & power draw of the starting level science core.
    * Added First Guided Rocket contract.
    * Modified early game contract requirement orders to permit more free play.
    * Made early mission control cheaper, added two more levels.
    * Made all starting parts cost nothing.
  * Changes to large vehicle progression.
    * Increased build rate of larger vehicles.
    * Increased cost of upgrades with time.
    * Decreased number of upgrades from science with time.

  IMPROVEMENTS:
  * Added an NQB toolbar icon.
  * Pruned more non-proc parts from the tree.
  * Made the high altitude contract requirements reasonable at altitudes where there is no lift.

  BUG FIXES:
  * Fixed broken contracts from 0.2.2.
  * Removed broken Contract tab from RP-1 window.
  * Fixed mission control upgrade costs.

**RP-NQB 0.2.2 Changelog:**

  * Overhauled the preorbital phase again. 
    * Remixed SR contracts bigtime:
      * Added Mass Spec SR contracts.
      * Changes to the downrange series should encourage more realistic booster designs instead of RP-NQB 0.2.2a Changelog:
  * Quick fixes:
    * Fixed a bug in the sound barrier contract.
    * Restored proper science costs to plane tech nodes.
    * Pruned a few more non-proc parts from the tree.
  * Added an NQB toolbar icon.clusterbee bumper spam.
      * Replaced High-Altitude SR contracts with Thermosphere Research SR contracts.
      * Simplified Photo SR contracts--ceiling removed.
      * Removed Heavy SR contract series.
      * Genericized SatPayloads so they can be used in SR contracts.
      * Finished Kerbalism integration with science SR contracts.
    * Expanded on plane contracts:
      * Merged PP-1 with KCT airlaunch capability.
      * Added more plane milestones.
      * Expanded existing X-Plane contract series & adapted those from PP-1.
      * Re-enabled and buffed value of suborbital flights.
  * Number of pads again granularly doubled.
  * Completely redid contract organization and gave agencies new handcrafted logos.
  * Bumped the value of the geosync contract.
  * Extended satellite deadlines to at least a year where it was less than a year before. Extended some sounding rocket contracts. 


**RP-NQB 0.2.1 Changelog:**

  * You earn reputation, which gives you a budget four times a year. More reputation = more money.
  * Revamped early game contracts, the sounding rocket era less sucky.
  * Completely redesigned satellite contracts. More difficult, more rewarding, and more interesting. Now fully integrated with kerbalism. 
  * There are more and cheaper building upgrades. Total building costs have been halved across the board.
  * KCT rate upgrades are twice as cheap but half as powerful.
  * You have two tech queues and can research multiple things at the same time.

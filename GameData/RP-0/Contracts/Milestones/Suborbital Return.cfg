	description = As early as 1947 the U.S. was launching into and recovering fruit flies from space on suborbital trajectories but it wasn't until 1951 that a monkey named Yorick and eleven mice were successfully recovered from an Aerobee flight. The Soviets preferred dogs and returned many from suborbital flights, the first two being Dezik and Tsygan in 1951 on top of an R-1. Although it is not a requirement to launch a biological capsule for this mission it is a perfect opportunity to do so. Send a rocket out of the atmosphere (140km) and return at least some of the craft back to Earth, intact, for study.
		
	synopsis = Return a suborbital spacecraft safely to Earth
		
	completedMessage = Well Done! Our scientists are now studying the sample to see the reactions from the journey.

  =head1 NAME
  
  YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language (tm)
  
  =head1 NOTE
  
  This module has been released to CPAN as YAML::Old, and soon YAML.pm
  will be changed to just be a frontend interface module for all the
  various Perl YAML implementation modules, including YAML::Old.
  
  If you want robust and fast YAML processing using the normal Dump/Load
  API, please consider switching to YAML::XS. It is by far the best Perl
  module for YAML at this time. It requires that you have a C compiler,
  since it is written in C.
  
  If you really need to use this version of YAML.pm it will always be
  available as YAML::Old.
  
  If you don't care which YAML module use, as long as it's the best one
  installed on your system, use YAML::Any.
  
  The rest of this documentation is left unchanged, until YAML.pm is
  switched over to the new UI-only version.

      You probably think YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language". It
      ain't! YAML is really a data serialization language. But if you want
      to think of it as a markup, that's OK with me. A lot of people try
      to use XML as a serialization format.
  
      "YAML" is catchy and fun to say. Try it. "YAML, YAML, YAML!!!"
      ...
  
      # Dump the Perl data structures back into YAML.
      print Dump($string, $arrayref, $hashref);
  
      # YAML::Dump is used the same way you'd use Data::Dumper::Dumper
      use Data::Dumper;
      print Dumper($string, $arrayref, $hashref);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  The YAML.pm module implements a YAML Loader and Dumper based on the YAML
  1.0 specification. L<http://www.yaml.org/spec/>
  
  YAML is a generic data serialization language that is optimized for
  human readability. It can be used to express the data structures of most
  modern programming languages. (Including Perl!!!)
  
  For information on the YAML syntax, please refer to the YAML
  specification.
  
  =head1 WHY YAML IS COOL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item YAML is readable for people.
  
  It makes clear sense out of complex data structures. You should find
  that YAML is an exceptional data dumping tool. Structure is shown
  through indentation, YAML supports recursive data, and hash keys are
  sorted by default. In addition, YAML supports several styles of scalar
  formatting for different types of data.
  
  =item YAML is editable.
  
  YAML was designed from the ground up to be an excellent syntax for
  configuration files. Almost all programs need configuration files, so
  why invent a new syntax for each one? And why subject users to the
  complexities of XML or native Perl code?
  
  =item YAML is multilingual.
  
  Yes, YAML supports Unicode. But I'm actually referring to programming
  languages. YAML was designed to meet the serialization needs of Perl,
  Python, Ruby, Tcl, PHP, Javascript and Java. It was also designed to be
  interoperable between those languages. That means YAML serializations
  produced by Perl can be processed by Python.
  
  =item YAML is taint safe.
  
  Using modules like Data::Dumper for serialization is fine as long as you
  can be sure that nobody can tamper with your data files or
  transmissions. That's because you need to use Perl's C<eval()> built-in
  to deserialize the data. Somebody could add a snippet of Perl to erase
  your files.
  
  YAML's parser does not need to eval anything.
  
  =item YAML is full featured.
  
  YAML can accurately serialize all of the common Perl data structures and
  deserialize them again without losing data relationships. Although it is
  not 100% perfect (no serializer is or can be perfect), it fares as well
  as the popular current modules: Data::Dumper, Storable, XML::Dumper and
  Data::Denter.
  
  YAML.pm also has the ability to handle code (subroutine) references and
  typeglobs. (Still experimental) These features are not found in Perl's
  other serialization modules.
  
  =item YAML is extensible.
  
  The YAML language has been designed to be flexible enough to solve it's
  own problems. The markup itself has 3 basic construct which resemble
  Perl's hash, array and scalar. By default, these map to their Perl
  equivalents. But each YAML node also supports a tagging mechanism (type
  system) which can cause that node to be interpreted in a completely
  different manner. That's how YAML can support object serialization and
  oddball structures like Perl's typeglob.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 YAML IMPLEMENTATIONS IN PERL
  
  This module, YAML.pm, is really just the interface module for YAML
  modules written in Perl. The basic interface for YAML consists of two
  functions: C<Dump> and C<Load>. The real work is done by the modules
  YAML::Dumper and YAML::Loader.
  
  Different YAML module distributions can be created by subclassing
  YAML.pm and YAML::Loader and YAML::Dumper. For example, YAML-Simple
  consists of YAML::Simple YAML::Dumper::Simple and YAML::Loader::Simple.
  
  Why would there be more than one implementation of YAML? Well, despite
  YAML's offering of being a simple data format, YAML is actually very
  deep and complex. Implementing the entirety of the YAML specification is
  a daunting task.
  
  For this reason I am currently working on 3 different YAML implementations.
  
  =over
  
  =item YAML
  
  The main YAML distribution will keeping evolving to support the entire
  YAML specification in pure Perl. This may not be the fastest or most
  stable module though. Currently, YAML.pm has lots of known bugs. It is
  mostly a great tool for dumping Perl data structures to a readable form.
  
  =item YAML::Tiny
  
  The point of YAML::Tiny is to strip YAML down to the 90% that people
  use most and offer that in a small, fast, stable, pure Perl form.
  YAML::Tiny will simply die when it is asked to do something it can't.
  
  =item YAML::Syck
  
  C<libsyck> is the C based YAML processing library used by the Ruby
  programming language (and also Python, PHP and Pugs). YAML::Syck is the
  Perl binding to C<libsyck>. It should be very fast, but may have
  problems of its own. It will also require C compilation.
  
  NOTE: Audrey Tang has actually completed this module and it works great
        and is 10 times faster than YAML.pm.
  
  =back
  
  In the future, there will likely be even more YAML modules. Remember,
  people other than Ingy are allowed to write YAML modules!
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONAL USAGE
  
  YAML is completely OO under the hood. Still it exports a few useful top
  level functions so that it is dead simple to use. These functions just
  do the OO stuff for you. If you want direct access to the OO API see the
  documentation for YAML::Dumper and YAML::Loader.
  
  =head2 Exported Functions
  
  The following functions are exported by YAML.pm by default. The reason
  they are exported is so that YAML works much like Data::Dumper. If you
  don't want functions to be imported, just use YAML with an empty
  import list:
  
      use YAML ();
  
  =over 4
  
  =item Dump(list-of-Perl-data-structures)
  
  Turn Perl data into YAML. This function works very much like
  Data::Dumper::Dumper(). It takes a list of Perl data structures and
  dumps them into a serialized form. It returns a string containing the
  YAML stream. The structures can be references or plain scalars.
  
  =item Load(string-containing-a-YAML-stream)
  
  Turn YAML into Perl data. This is the opposite of Dump. Just like
  Storable's thaw() function or the eval() function in relation to
  Data::Dumper. It parses a string containing a valid YAML stream into a
  list of Perl data structures.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Exportable Functions
  
  These functions are not exported by default but you can request them in
  an import list like this:
  
      use YAML qw'freeze thaw Bless';
  
  =over 4
  
  =item freeze() and thaw()
  
  Aliases to Dump() and Load() for Storable fans. This will also allow
  YAML.pm to be plugged directly into modules like POE.pm, that use the
  freeze/thaw API for internal serialization.
  
  =item DumpFile(filepath, list)
  
  Writes the YAML stream to a file instead of just returning a string.
  
  =item LoadFile(filepath)
  
  Reads the YAML stream from a file instead of a string.
  
  =item Bless(perl-node, [yaml-node | class-name])
  
  Associate a normal Perl node, with a yaml node. A yaml node is an object
  tied to the YAML::Node class. The second argument is either a yaml node
  that you've already created or a class (package) name that supports a
  yaml_dump() function. A yaml_dump() function should take a perl node and
  return a yaml node. If no second argument is provided, Bless will create
  a yaml node. This node is not returned, but can be retrieved with the
  Blessed() function.
  
  Here's an example of how to use Bless. Say you have a hash containing
  three keys, but you only want to dump two of them. Furthermore the keys
  must be dumped in a certain order. Here's how you do that:
  
      use YAML qw(Dump Bless);
      $hash = {apple => 'good', banana => 'bad', cauliflower => 'ugly'};
      print Dump $hash;
      Bless($hash)->keys(['banana', 'apple']);
      print Dump $hash;
  
  produces:
  
      ---
      apple: good
      banana: bad
      cauliflower: ugly
      ---
      banana: bad
      apple: good
  
  Bless returns the tied part of a yaml-node, so that you can call the
  YAML::Node methods. This is the same thing that YAML::Node::ynode()
  returns. So another way to do the above example is:
  
      use YAML qw(Dump Bless);
      use YAML::Node;
      $hash = {apple => 'good', banana => 'bad', cauliflower => 'ugly'};
      print Dump $hash;
      Bless($hash);
      $ynode = ynode(Blessed($hash));
      $ynode->keys(['banana', 'apple']);
      print Dump $hash;
  
  Note that Blessing a Perl data structure does not change it anyway. The
  extra information is stored separately and looked up by the Blessed
  node's memory address.
  
  =item Blessed(perl-node)
  
  Returns the yaml node that a particular perl node is associated with
  (see above). Returns undef if the node is not (YAML) Blessed.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS
  
  YAML options are set using a group of global variables in the YAML
  namespace. This is similar to how Data::Dumper works.
  
  For example, to change the indentation width, do something like:
  
      local $YAML::Indent = 3;
  
  The current options are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item DumperClass
  
  You can override which module/class YAML uses for Dumping data.
  
  =item LoaderClass
  
  You can override which module/class YAML uses for Loading data.
  
  =item Indent
  
  This is the number of space characters to use for each indentation level
  when doing a Dump(). The default is 2.
  
  By the way, YAML can use any number of characters for indentation at any
  level. So if you are editing YAML by hand feel free to do it anyway that
  looks pleasing to you; just be consistent for a given level.
  
  =item SortKeys
  
  Default is 1. (true)
  
  Tells YAML.pm whether or not to sort hash keys when storing a document.
  
  YAML::Node objects can have their own sort order, which is usually what
  you want. To override the YAML::Node order and sort the keys anyway, set
  SortKeys to 2.
  
  =item Stringify
  
  Default is 0. (false)
  
  Objects with string overloading should honor the overloading and dump the
  stringification of themselves, rather than the actual object's guts.
  
  =item UseHeader
  
  Default is 1. (true)
  
  This tells YAML.pm whether to use a separator string for a Dump
  operation. This only applies to the first document in a stream.
  Subsequent documents must have a YAML header by definition.
  
  =item UseVersion
  
  Default is 0. (false)
  
  Tells YAML.pm whether to include the YAML version on the
  separator/header.
  
      --- %YAML:1.0
  
  =item AnchorPrefix
  
  Default is ''.
  
  Anchor names are normally numeric. YAML.pm simply starts with '1' and
  increases by one for each new anchor. This option allows you to specify a
  string to be prepended to each anchor number.
  
  =item UseCode
  
  Setting the UseCode option is a shortcut to set both the DumpCode and
  LoadCode options at once. Setting UseCode to '1' tells YAML.pm to dump
  Perl code references as Perl (using B::Deparse) and to load them back
  into memory using eval(). The reason this has to be an option is that
  using eval() to parse untrusted code is, well, untrustworthy.
  
  =item DumpCode
  
  Determines if and how YAML.pm should serialize Perl code references. By
  default YAML.pm will dump code references as dummy placeholders (much
  like Data::Dumper). If DumpCode is set to '1' or 'deparse', code
  references will be dumped as actual Perl code.
  
  DumpCode can also be set to a subroutine reference so that you can
  write your own serializing routine. YAML.pm passes you the code ref. You
  pass back the serialization (as a string) and a format indicator. The
  format indicator is a simple string like: 'deparse' or 'bytecode'.
  
  =item LoadCode
  
  LoadCode is the opposite of DumpCode. It tells YAML if and how to
  deserialize code references. When set to '1' or 'deparse' it will use
  C<eval()>. Since this is potentially risky, only use this option if you
  know where your YAML has been.
  
  LoadCode can also be set to a subroutine reference so that you can write
  your own deserializing routine. YAML.pm passes the serialization (as a
  string) and a format indicator. You pass back the code reference.
  
  =item UseBlock
  
  YAML.pm uses heuristics to guess which scalar style is best for a given
  node. Sometimes you'll want all multiline scalars to use the 'block'
  style. If so, set this option to 1.
  
  NOTE: YAML's block style is akin to Perl's here-document.
  
  =item UseFold
  
  If you want to force YAML to use the 'folded' style for all multiline
  scalars, then set $UseFold to 1.
  
  NOTE: YAML's folded style is akin to the way HTML folds text,
        except smarter.
  
  =item UseAliases
  
  YAML has an alias mechanism such that any given structure in memory gets
  serialized once. Any other references to that structure are serialized
  only as alias markers. This is how YAML can serialize duplicate and
  recursive structures.
  
  Sometimes, when you KNOW that your data is nonrecursive in nature, you
  may want to serialize such that every node is expressed in full. (ie as
  a copy of the original). Setting $YAML::UseAliases to 0 will allow you
  to do this. This also may result in faster processing because the lookup
  overhead is by bypassed.
  
  THIS OPTION CAN BE DANGEROUS. *If* your data is recursive, this option
  *will* cause Dump() to run in an endless loop, chewing up your computers
  memory. You have been warned.
  
  =item CompressSeries
  
  Default is 1.
  
  Compresses the formatting of arrays of hashes:
  
      -
        foo: bar
      -
        bar: foo
  
  becomes:
  
      - foo: bar
      - bar: foo
  
  Since this output is usually more desirable, this option is turned on by
  default.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 YAML TERMINOLOGY
  
  YAML is a full featured data serialization language, and thus has its
  own terminology.
  
  It is important to remember that although YAML is heavily influenced by
  Perl and Python, it is a language in its own right, not merely just a
  representation of Perl structures.
  
  YAML has three constructs that are conspicuously similar to Perl's hash,
  array, and scalar. They are called mapping, sequence, and string
  respectively. By default, they do what you would expect. But each
  instance may have an explicit or implicit tag (type) that makes it
  behave differently. In this manner, YAML can be extended to represent
  Perl's Glob or Python's tuple, or Ruby's Bigint.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item stream
  
  A YAML stream is the full sequence of Unicode characters that a YAML
  parser would read or a YAML emitter would write. A stream may contain
  one or more YAML documents separated by YAML headers.
  
      ---
      a: mapping
      foo: bar
      ---
      - a
      - sequence
  
  =item document
  
  A YAML document is an independent data structure representation within a
  stream. It is a top level node. Each document in a YAML stream must
  begin with a YAML header line. Actually the header is optional on the
  first document.
  
      ---
      This: top level mapping
      is:
          - a
          - YAML
          - document
  
  =item header
  
  A YAML header is a line that begins a YAML document. It consists of
  three dashes, possibly followed by more info. Another purpose of the
  header line is that it serves as a place to put top level tag and anchor
  information.
  
      --- !recursive-sequence &001
      - * 001
      - * 001
  
  =item node
  
  A YAML node is the representation of a particular data structure. Nodes
  may contain other nodes. (In Perl terms, nodes are like scalars.
  Strings, arrayrefs and hashrefs. But this refers to the serialized
  format, not the in-memory structure.)
  
  =item tag
  
  This is similar to a type. It indicates how a particular YAML node
  serialization should be transferred into or out of memory. For instance
  a Foo::Bar object would use the tag 'perl/Foo::Bar':
  
      - !perl/Foo::Bar
          foo: 42
          bar: stool
  
  =item collection
  
  A collection is the generic term for a YAML data grouping. YAML has two
  types of collections: mappings and sequences. (Similar to hashes and arrays)
  
  =item mapping
  
  A mapping is a YAML collection defined by unordered key/value pairs with
  unique keys. By default YAML mappings are loaded into Perl hashes.
  
      a mapping:
          foo: bar
          two: times two is 4
  
  =item sequence
  
  A sequence is a YAML collection defined by an ordered list of elements. By
  default YAML sequences are loaded into Perl arrays.
  
      a sequence:
          - one bourbon
          - one scotch
          - one beer
  
  =item scalar
  
  A scalar is a YAML node that is a single value. By default YAML scalars
  are loaded into Perl scalars.
  
      a scalar key: a scalar value
  
  YAML has many styles for representing scalars. This is important because
  varying data will have varying formatting requirements to retain the
  optimum human readability.
  
  =item plain scalar
  
  A plain scalar is unquoted. All plain scalars are automatic candidates
  for "implicit tagging". This means that their tag may be determined
  automatically by examination. The typical uses for this are plain alpha
  strings, integers, real numbers, dates, times and currency.
  
      - a plain string
      - -42
      - 3.1415
      - 12:34
      - 123 this is an error
  
  =item single quoted scalar
  
  This is similar to Perl's use of single quotes. It means no escaping
  except for single quotes which are escaped by using two adjacent
  single quotes.
  
      - 'When I say ''\n'' I mean "backslash en"'
  
  =item double quoted scalar
  
  This is similar to Perl's use of double quotes. Character escaping can
  be used.

  This is a multiline scalar which begins on the next line. It is
  indicated by a single right angle bracket. It is unescaped like the
  single quoted scalar. Line folding is also performed.

       This is a multiline scalar which begins on
       the next line. It is indicated by a single
       carat. It is unescaped like the single
       quoted scalar. Line folding is also

  =item block scalar
  
  This final multiline form is akin to Perl's here-document except that
  (as in all YAML data) scope is indicated by indentation. Therefore, no
  ending marker is required. The data is verbatim. No line folding.

  =item parser
  
  A YAML processor has four stages: parse, load, dump, emit.
  
  A parser parses a YAML stream. YAML.pm's Load() function contains a
  parser.
  
  =item loader
  
  The other half of the Load() function is a loader. This takes the
  information from the parser and loads it into a Perl data structure.
  
  =item dumper
  
  The Dump() function consists of a dumper and an emitter. The dumper
  walks through each Perl data structure and gives info to the emitter.
  
  =item emitter
  
  The emitter takes info from the dumper and turns it into a YAML stream.
  
  NOTE:
  In YAML.pm the parser/loader and the dumper/emitter code are currently
  very closely tied together. In the future they may be broken into
  separate stages.

  For more information please refer to the immensely helpful YAML
  specification available at L<http://www.yaml.org/spec/>.
  
  =head1 ysh - The YAML Shell
  
  The YAML distribution ships with a script called 'ysh', the YAML shell.
  ysh provides a simple, interactive way to play with YAML. If you type in
  Perl code, it displays the result in YAML. If you type in YAML it turns
  it into Perl code.
  
  To run ysh, (assuming you installed it along with YAML.pm) simply type:
  
      ysh [options]
  
  Please read the C<ysh> documentation for the full details. There are
  lots of options.
  
  =head1 BUGS & DEFICIENCIES
  
  If you find a bug in YAML, please try to recreate it in the YAML Shell
  with logging turned on ('ysh -L'). When you have successfully reproduced
  the bug, please mail the LOG file to the author (ingy@cpan.org).
  
  WARNING: This is still *ALPHA* code. Well, most of this code has been
  around for years...
  
  BIGGER WARNING: YAML.pm has been slow in the making, but I am committed
  to having top notch YAML tools in the Perl world. The YAML team is close
  to finalizing the YAML 1.1 spec. This version of YAML.pm is based off of
  a very old pre 1.0 spec. In actuality there isn't a ton of difference,
  and this YAML.pm is still fairly useful. Things will get much better in
  the future.

  =head1 NAME
  
  YAML::Node - A generic data node that encapsulates YAML information
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use YAML;
      use YAML::Node;
  
      my $ynode = YAML::Node->new({}, 'ingerson.com/fruit');
      %$ynode = qw(orange orange apple red grape green);
      print Dump $ynode;
  
  yields:
  
      --- !ingerson.com/fruit
      orange: orange
      apple: red
      grape: green
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  A generic node in YAML is similar to a plain hash, array, or scalar node
  in Perl except that it must also keep track of its type. The type is a
  URI called the YAML type tag.
  
  YAML::Node is a class for generating and manipulating these containers.
  A YAML node (or ynode) is a tied hash, array or scalar. In most ways it
  behaves just like the plain thing. But you can assign and retrieve and
  YAML type tag URI to it. For the hash flavor, you can also assign the
  order that the keys will be retrieved in. By default a ynode will offer
  its keys in the same order that they were assigned.
  
  YAML::Node has a class method call new() that will return a ynode. You
  pass it a regular node and an optional type tag. After that you can
  use it like a normal Perl node, but when you YAML::Dump it, the magical
  properties will be honored.
  
  This is how you can control the sort order of hash keys during a YAML
  serialization. By default, YAML sorts keys alphabetically. But notice
  in the above example that the keys were Dumped in the same order they
  were assigned.
  
  YAML::Node exports a function called ynode(). This function returns the tied object so that you can call special methods on it like ->keys().
  
  keys() works like this:
  
      use YAML;
      use YAML::Node;
  
      %$node = qw(orange orange apple red grape green);
      $ynode = YAML::Node->new($node);
      ynode($ynode)->keys(['grape', 'apple']);
      print Dump $ynode;
  
  produces:
  
      ---
      grape: green
      apple: red
  
  It tells the ynode which keys and what order to use.
  
  ynodes will play a very important role in how programs use YAML. They
  are the foundation of how a Perl class can marshall the Loading and
  Dumping of its objects.
  
  The upcoming versions of YAML.pm will have much more information on this.

  autodie::Scope::GuardStack -  Hook stack for managing scopes via %^H
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use autodie::Scope::GuardStack;
      my $stack = autodie::Scope::GuardStack->new
      $^H{'my-key'} = $stack;
  
      $stack->push_hook(sub {});
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This class is a stack of hooks to be called in the right order as
  scopes go away.  The stack is only useful when inserted into C<%^H>
  and will pop hooks as their "scope" is popped.  This is useful for
  uninstalling or reinstalling subs in a namespace as a pragma goes
  out of scope.
  
  Due to how C<%^H> works, this class is only useful during the
  compilation phase of a perl module and relies on the internals of how
  perl handles references in C<%^H>.  This module is not a part of
  autodie's public API.
  
  =head2 Methods
  
  =head3 new
  
    my $stack = autodie::Scope::GuardStack->new;
  
  Creates a new C<autodie::Scope::GuardStack>.  The stack is initially
  empty and must be inserted into C<%^H> by the creator.
  
  =head3 push_hook
  
    $stack->push_hook(sub {});
  
  Add a sub to the stack.  The sub will be called once the current
  compile-time "scope" is left.  Multiple hooks can be added per scope

      use autodie::ScopeUtil qw(on_end_of_compile_scope);

  Utilities for abstracting away the underlying magic of (ab)using
  C<%^H> to call subs at the end of a (compile-time) scopes.
  
  Due to how C<%^H> works, these utilities are only useful during the
  compilation phase of a perl module and relies on the internals of how

  =head2 Methods
  
  =head3 on_end_of_compile_scope
  
    on_end_of_compile_scope(sub { print "Hallo world\n"; });
  
  Will invoke a sub at the end of a (compile-time) scope.  The sub is
  called once with no arguments.  Can be called multiple times (even in
  the same "compile-time" scope) to install multiple subs.  Subs are
  called in a "first-in-last-out"-order (FILO or "stack"-order).

	description = Figuring out how many batteries we need for a satellite is good for simple ones, but as we get more complex, we need ways to fulfill greater energy needs. The first way we can do that is to generate power so we don't have to rely on only batteries. Launch a satellite that has solar power on it.

	synopsis = Launch a solar powered satellite

	completedMessage = Success! This is an important step in increasing the usefulness of our satellites in orbit.

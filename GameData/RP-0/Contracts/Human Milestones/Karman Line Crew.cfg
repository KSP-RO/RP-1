	description = Although the Earth's atmosphere extends far further than 100km above sea level, the Karman Line is the traditional separator between it and space. The Karman Line is where the speed necessary to maintain altitude via lift, is the same as the speed required for orbit. Putting a human above this line also represents a milestone target for the early space program. Before attempting this milestone make sure you have time to research and build a spacecraft capable of the task, there is a hard deadline to meet. While passing the Karman Line is the goal of every spacecraft very few have been specifically designed to not reach orbit afterwards. Examples include the Mercury capsule (1961, 1.4 tons, Mercury-Redstone), the X-15 (1963, 15.4 tons loaded, B-52), and SpaceShipOne (2004, 3.6 tons, White Knight).

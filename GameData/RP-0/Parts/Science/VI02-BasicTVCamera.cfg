	description = The Basic TV Camera is used to take images in the visibile wavelength of planetary bodies from space. This is an early camera and lacks resolution in the images. Historically, this type of camera was flown on Mariner 4 and took the first images of another planet.\n\nThe images can be transmitted for full science value. Level 2 Visible Imaging Experiment can gather 25% of Visible Imaging Science.

	description = <b>Program: Crewed Spaceplane Development<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Single-person orbital spaceplanes were not historically built, but a number of concepts were studied and X-20 Dyna-Soar (1966 planned, Titan III) even began construction, paving the way for later more capable vehicles. Design, build, and launch a spaceplane that remains for @/NoOfOrbits orbits and return the crew safely back to Earth.&br;&br;<b><color=white>NOTE: You can not select this contract and the Orbital Flight (One Crew) or Orbital Spaceplane with Maneuvers and 2+ Crew contract. If you select the other contract while this is active, this will automatically fail.</color></b>&br;&br;<b><color=yellow>NOTE: This contract requires a horizontal landing on the space center runway. If playing from the Cape, the Space Shuttle runway provided by the RSS-CanaveralHD mod is also a valid landing target. Make sure to plan your orbit to allow reentry in the right place.</color></b>&br;&br;<b>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / unlimited</b>

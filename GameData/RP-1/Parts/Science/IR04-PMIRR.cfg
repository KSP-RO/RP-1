//Mars Observer Pressure Modulator Infrared Radiometer
//mass: 40.2 kg [1], 44.1 kg [3]

//bit rate: 0.156 kbps (average) [1] 156 bps [3]
//Gregorian telescope with 2-axis scan mirror, focusing through splitters onto 9 sensors, with an operating range of 0.3 to 50 microns, and two 
//pressure modulator cells. FoV 0.19x0.95 degrees.

//mass: 8.98 kg [4]
//power consumption: 11 Watts [4]

//Hard to find much good data on this because both Mars Observer and Mars Climate Orbiter were destroyed before orbit insertion...
//Mars climate sounder is similar, but heavily modernized, and also hard to find data on.
//Just take 156 bps data rate, and give it a very long duration since it is intended for an orbiter, ~15 days

	manufacturer = DMagic
	description = The PMIRR used narrow-band radiometric channels and two pressure modulation cells to measure atmospheric and surface emission in the thermal infrared and a visible channel. This could determine solar radiation reflected from the atmosphere and surface. These measurements can determine what seasons are like on other planets and determine how the contents of an atmosphere vary across altitudes and across locations. Historically, this experiment is based on the instrument that flew on Mars Observer.

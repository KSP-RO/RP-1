	description = <b>Program: Venus Surface Exploration<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Design and successfully launch an uncrewed probe that will soft land on Venus and transmit a science report from the surface. &br;&br;It is very hot on Venus, so please be sure to account for this in the type of parachutes you choose to pack. <br>Historical example: Venera 7 (500kg, Molniya 8K78M) launched in August of 1970<br>

	synopsis = Send an uncrewed probe to land on Venus

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Landing a probe on another planetary body in our system is no easy feat! The science gathered from this lander will unlock some of the secrets of our Solar System.

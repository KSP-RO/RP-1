        #rp1_kct_tags_avionics = Avionics
        #rp1_kct_tags_avionics_desc = Has avionics to control the craft, requiring extensive testing.

        #rp1_kct_tags_cockpit = Cockpit
        #rp1_kct_tags_cockpit_desc = Has a cockpit.

        #rp1_kct_tags_engineliquidpf = Pressure-Fed Engine
        #rp1_kct_tags_engineliquidpf_desc = Has a pressure-fed liquid rocket engine that requires some additional testing.

        #rp1_kct_tags_engineliquidturbo = Pump-Fed Engine
        #rp1_kct_tags_engineliquidturbo_desc = Has a pump-fed liquid rocket engine. The turbopump is a very complicated piece of machinery that requires extensive testing.

        #rp1_kct_tags_enginesolid = Solid Rocket Motor
        #rp1_kct_tags_enginesolid_desc = Has a solid rocket motor. Much easier to integrate and test than liquid engines.

        #rp1_kct_tags_humanrated = Human-Rated
        #rp1_kct_tags_humanrated_desc = Has human-rated equipment that requires more time for integration and testing of the entire craft.

        #rp1_kct_tags_instruments = Instruments
        #rp1_kct_tags_instruments_desc = Has scientific instruments. Currently, no effect on launch cost.

        #rp1_kct_tags_nuclear = Nuclear Reactor
        #rp1_kct_tags_nuclear_desc = Has radioactive elements that must be carefully handled and integrated, and require additional administrative permits.

        #rp1_kct_tags_nuclearrtg = Nuclear RTG
        #rp1_kct_tags_nuclearrtg_desc = Has radioactive elements that must be carefully handled and integrated, and require additional administrative permits.

        #rp1_kct_tags_reentry = Reentry-Rated
        #rp1_kct_tags_reentry_desc = Has reentry equipment that needs proper integration and testing for safety.

        #rp1_kct_tags_tankballoon = Balloon Tank
        #rp1_kct_tags_tankballoon_desc = Has a Balloon Tank that is very difficult to handle and must be pressurized properly at all times.

        #rp1_kct_tags_tankservicemodule = Service Module Tank
        #rp1_kct_tags_tankservicemodule_desc = Has a Service Module tank, specially designed to hold many different resources. This flexibility and complexity increases the launch cost.

        #rp1_kct_tags_toxic = Toxic Propellants
        #rp1_kct_tags_toxic_desc = Has toxic propellants that need to be handled carefully prior to launch. Currently, these do not increase launch cost.

        #rp1_kct_tags_padinfrastructure = Pad Infrastructure
        #rp1_kct_tags_padinfrastructure_desc = Part of the pad infrastructure and does not contribute to build time or assesed mass/size.

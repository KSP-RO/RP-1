	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = <b>Program: Crewed Spaceplane Development<br>Type: <color=red>Capstone</color></b><br><br>A use for space shuttles is orbital servicing, docking to an existing satellite and performing repairs, like the Space Shuttle did to fix the Hubble Space Telescope. Docking is also necessary to bring crew to space stations. Perform the first docking between a spaceplane and another spacecraft.&br;&br;<b><color=white>NOTE: You can not select this contract and 'First Docking' at the same time. If you select the other contract while this is active, this will automatically fail.</color></b>&br;&br;<b><color=yellow>NOTE: This contract requires a horizontal landing on the space center runway.</color> If playing from the Cape, the Space Shuttle runway provided by the RSS-CanaveralHD mod is also a valid landing target.</b>

	synopsis = Perform a docking of two vessels in orbit of Earth, then bring one back to a runway landing

	completedMessage = Nice Work! Docking capability will make our spaceplanes much more useful.

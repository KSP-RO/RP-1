The rocket-powered aircraft was dropped from the bomb bay of a B-29 and acheived a speed of Mach 1.06 (361 m/s). The Soviets accomplished the feat in 1948 with a Lavochkin La-176 and the British in 1948 with a de Havilland DH.108.

For the first time, rocketry is not a weapon of hostile destruction, but an instrument to further our understanding of the universe. We are all hoping that as an age of world wars ends, an age of cosmic discovery will begin and this flight marks the beginning of an era where the stars will start to seem closer and closer.\n<color=#0000>(tab)</color>Historical Information: The first real life rocket to do this was V-2 No. 3 on 10 May 1946. Launched from White Sands as part of the Hermes program, it carried a geiger counter to measure cosmic radiation. The Hermes program combined scientific and military objectives, but it still marked the first suborbital spaceflight to carry scientific instruments.

This startled the US and started the Space Race.

	article = <color=#0000>(tab)</color>The first space probe to include equipment for measuring cosmic rays has revealed belts of charged particles around the Earth. Instead of circling right above us, <<2>> goes through an elaborate ballet. It shoots up to an altitude of more than a thousand kilometers before coming closer, speeding up, and then soaring back out. Due to the strange nature of orbital mechanics, this requires no energy expenditure once in motion.  It slows down and speeds up purely from the laws of nature that Newton discovered almost 300 years ago.\n<color=#0000>(tab)</color>Historical Information: Explorer 1, launched by the USAF on 31 February, 1958, was the first scientific satellite. Dr. James Van Allen was in charge of the scientific instrumentation for the satellite, and so the radiation belts  were named after him. Your rocket may not actually be following Newton's laws, as  you need the mod "Principia" to simulate N-body gravitational interactions. For new players, the stock two-body approximation is easier to understand.

While staying still may sound easy, this required perfect alignment of the satellite's orbit through months of work.  This allows easy alignment of ground-based communications equipment and will make possible new forms of communication.\n<color=#0000>(tab)</color>Historical Information: The concept of a geostationary satellite was proposed in 1929, and later popularized by Arthur C. Clarke. The first operational satellite to reach this orbit was Syncom 3, launched by the US on August 19, 1964. Today, we use geostationary orbits for communications, weather, and navigation satellites.

Not too long ago, we thought that Venus might be a tropical paradise with lush jungles, but this probe corroborates recent telescope findings --- Venus is not a jungle, it is a furnace. The atmosphere is 500 degrees Celsius, well above the melting point of lead. Though it is not pleasant, it is still of scientific interest and this probe has furthered our knowledge.\n<color=#0000>(tab)</color>Historical Information: Venera 1, launched by the Soviet Union in February of 1961, was the first spacecraft to reach Venus, passing within 100,000 km. However, the probe failed due to an overheated solar-direction sensor. The first successful mission to Venus was Mariner 2, launched by the US in August of 1962 and arriving on 14 December, 1962. That is what gave that 500 degree number, as well as revealing Venus's lack of magnetic field, providing info about the content of interplanetary space, and doing some early research on solar wind.

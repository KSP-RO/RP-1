  title = Experimental Transpacific Telephony
  description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>For a Transpacific satellite telecom system to be viable, it must provide a sustained link, not just a few minutes until the satellite passes below the horizon. Provide a Transpacific connection that supports a few voice channels for at least 12 hours a day. The lower required data rate should allow a very small satellite to be used, opening up the possibility for higher orbits.<br>Historical example: Syncom 3 (34kg, Thor-Delta)

  synopsis = Provide Transpacific telephony for three months with 50% availability (~12 hours per day). Open the Skopos window (pink wave) to view the current connection status.

  notes = Earth stations with cutting-edge antennas have been built in Kashima (Kashima prefecture, Japan), and at Point Mugu (California, USA). It should be possible to establish a transpacific link with a very small satellite. Open the Skopos window (pink wave) in the tracking station and select the "show network" button to view their location.\nThe experimental transpacific transmissions are mutually exclusive; while you must provide support for both westward and eastward television broadcasts, your satellite does not need to have the capacity for those to happen at the same time.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a transpacific link via satellite, paving the way for a commercial operating system.

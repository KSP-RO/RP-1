{
	name = first_NavSat
	title = First Rudimentary Navigational Satellite
	group = Milestones

	description = Through measuring the Doppler shift of radio signals transmitted from a satellite in a known orbit, it is possible for a receiver on the ground to establish their location, which would have many applications both civilian and military. To test the principle and develop receiver equipment, construct a rudimentary navigational satellite and place it in orbit for testing. The orbit we select should be inclined as to cover as much ground as possible. <br>Real life examples: Transit 1A, 1B.

	synopsis = Launch the first rudimentary navigation satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite is in orbit and we have already begun to receive rudimentary Doppler curves.

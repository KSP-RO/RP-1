	group = Orbits
		
	description = Despite it being so essential to life on earth, we know very little about our star. We need you to make detailed, comprehensive measurements of the solar magnetic field and cosmic rays from locations distant from Earth. Build, design, and launch a probe into interplanetary space to provide practical data on solar storms which affect communications and power on Earth.<br><b>Make sure your craft contains a cosmic ray Science experiment and magnetic scan experiment as we will need science returned.</b><br>This contract may be repeated five times. Currently @index have been completed.<br>Real life examples: Pioneers 6-9, Pioneer E (failed)

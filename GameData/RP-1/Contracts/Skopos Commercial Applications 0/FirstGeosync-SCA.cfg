	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>With an orbital period of an earth day, a satellite will remain above a constant longitude, appearing to drift north and south through the day. This orbit will be able to provide a constant line of sight for satellite earth stations at low latitudes, but at high latitudes it may still drift too far north or south to be used for portions of the day. However, forgoing an inclination change burn makes this orbit easier to get to than a proper geostationary orbit.<br><br>See the RP-1 wiki for more information on how to get to a geostationary orbit.<br>Historical example: Syncom 2 (36kg, Thor-Delta).

	synopsis = Launch a geosynchronous test satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite is in orbit and connected to the satellite earth station.

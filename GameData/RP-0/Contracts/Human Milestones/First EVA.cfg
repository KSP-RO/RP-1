	group = HumanMilestones
	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = Design, build, and launch into orbit a capsule that contains a human being, then perform a spacewalk, recording observations during the EVA and immediately transmitting them home. Finally, return her/him alive and well to the surface of the Earth. You'll need to complete at least a single orbit (90 minutes) with a perigee above 150km before you try the spacewalk.

	synopsis = Perform a spacewalk during an orbital mission (with report), then return safe.

	completedMessage = A spacewalk, and then a safe return. Excellent work!

	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>After the success of your first weather satellite, your government wants additional satellites available for more timely weather observations with better coverage of Earth. Launch an additional weather satellite to fulfill their request.<br><br><b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains an Infrared Radiometry 1 experiment and an Early TV camera. Science requirements can be met over multiple launches.</color></b><br><br>Historical examples: TIROS-2 through TIROS-8.

	synopsis = Launch the first weather satellite with the Infrared Radiometry experiment and an Early TV camera.

	completedMessage = Success! The images provided from this satellite have proven that weather satellites can be extremely effective in helping meteorologists predict the weather.

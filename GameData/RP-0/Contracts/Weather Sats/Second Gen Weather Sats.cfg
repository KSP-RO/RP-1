	description = Our experience has given us a better understanding of the best orbits to use for weather satellites. Please launch a new weather satellite into the proper orbit that is sun synchronous.\n\nRemember that Sun Synchronous orbits are slightly retrograde.<b><color=white>NOTE: You can not select this contract and the Geostationary Weather contract. If you select the other contract while this is active, this will automatically fail.</color></b>

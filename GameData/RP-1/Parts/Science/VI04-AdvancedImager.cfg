//Galileo Solid State Imaging System
//mass: 28 kg
//power consumption: 23 watts (peak), 15 watts (average)
//Catadioptric telescope with 0.46x0.46 degree FoV, mated to CCD with an 800x800 pixel resolution, 
//with 8 bits per pixel [2]
//8 modes could be selected, including 8 filters [2]
//60.667 seconds per frame, with 5,120,000 bits each [2] (faster frames at lower accuracy available)
//Galileo tape recorder could transfer data at about 806.4 kbits/s [2]
//About 70,000 useful images expected to be returned by Galileo [2]

//70,000 frames / 6-ish objects (Jupiter, 4 Galilean moons, other moons) * 5.12 Mbit/frame
// = 59,733,333,333 bits per biome (7,466.67 MB)
//Limit data rate to 806.4 kbit/s of tape recorder, we end up with a duration of about 74,074 seconds, or
//21 hours

	description = The Advanced Visible Imaging Device is used to take images in the visibile wavelength of planetary bodies from space. This camera is fully digital, which makes it able to function in low-light conditions and reduces mass and power draw. Historically, this type of camera was flown on Galileo and took images of Jupiter and it's moons.

After Korolev's death it was named ЦБКЭМ (TsKBEM, "Central Design Bureau of Experimental Mechanical Engineering"). Due to constand delays of N-1 rocket program, the head of ЦБКЭМ, Vasily Mishin was replaced with Valentin Glushko, and ЦБКЭМ was reformed into НПО "Энергия" (NPO Energia, "Research and produtcion association Energia") with the inclusion of Design Bureau Energomash (OKB-456). Since then Energia have designed Mir station, Buran spacecraft and Russian Orbital Segment of the ISS. After the fall of the Soviet Union it was reformed into corporation and is now called Ракетно-космическая корпорация «Энергия» им. С. П. Королёва ("Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia")

They developed the AJ-10, one of the longest lasting engine families out there, the Aerobee and Titan rockets, and competed with Rocketdyne to provide engines for the Saturn V, though Rocketdyne won for all of the lower stages. Aerojet developed from a 1936 meeting with Theodore von Kármán and a number of Caltech professors and students, including Fritz Zwicky and Jack Parsons, all of whom were interested in the topic of spaceflight. Their first design was tested on August 16, 1941, consisting of a small solid-fuel motor attached to the bottom of a plane. Takeoff distance was shortened by half, and the USAAF placed an order for experimental production versions. They saw a lot of success in the early days of spaceflight, but, like many U.S. rocket companies, they downsized during during the late 80s and early 90s. They started to grow again in the early 2000s and bought Rocketdyne in 2012.

//Galileo Orbiter Near-infrared Mapping Spectrometer
//mass: 18 kg [1]
//power consumption: 12 Watts (average) [1]
//Diffraction grating spectrometer with 0.03 x 0.57 degree FoV, operating as a whisk-broom scanner.
//17 detectors ranging from 700 nm to 5200 nm, mechanically swept to create 20 pixel wide swath, with 
//10 bits per detector. [3]
//0.33 seconds per sample. [3]
//Several scan modes, including single pixel, every 4 pixels, or double-sampling pixels [3]
//wanted sun angle of less than 30 degrees for best performance.
//11.52 kbit/s data transfer to spacecraft bus [3]
//(17 detectors * 20 pixels * 10 bits)/0.33 seconds = 10.2 kbit/s, remaining 1.3 kbit/s is presumably 
//calibration and engineering data

//Galileo Orbiter Ultraviolet Spectrometer (mounted coaxial with NIMS)
//mass: 5.2 kg [3] (not including EUVS)
//power consumption: 2.4 Watts (average) [3] (not including EUVS)
//Cassegrain telescope with 0.1 x 1.0 degree FoV, mated to three detectors capable of 113 nm to 432 nm,
//operating as whisk-broom scanner. Capable of sweeping 528 positions, divided among 3 sensors, with
//8 bits per detector. [3]
//4.33 seconds per sample [3]
//1 kbit/s data transfer to spacecraft bus [3]
//(528 pixels * 8 bits)/ 4.33 seconds = 975 bit/s, + 33 bit/s engineering data

//NIMS+UVS
//mass = 23.3 kg
//power = 14.4 Watts
//Considering wider FoV and low demands, just assume UVS is active any time NIMS is active
//NIMS starts imaging 4 hours before closest approach, so about 8 hours of data per pass?
//If we're restricted by a sun angle of ~30 degrees, only about a 6th of the planet will have acceptable
//lighting conditions (less because of poles)
//About 48 hours needed for "good" coverage? Double for balance, and because we probably want to watch for
//changes between passes
//48 hours * 12520 bit/s * 2 = 4,326,912,000 bits (540.864 MB)

	description = The NIMS and UVS experiments are used to provide information on the vertical structure, composition, and dynamics of the atmosphere and on the emmissive properties from the surface and atmospheres of planetary bodies in the infrared wavelengths. Historically, these experiments were flown on many craft including Galileo.

	title = Crewed Venus Flyby
	
	description = Design, build, and launch a crewed spacecraft into cytherean space (with a periapsis under 30000km), and return safely to Earth (hint: you can use Venus gravity assist) . Note that once you commit to going to the Venus, you have to follow through: this contract has a deadline, and you'll suffer quite the penalty to your budget and prestige if you don't succeed. Make sure you have time to research everything you'll need!
	
	synopsis = Send a human being into cytherean space and return safely.
	
	completedMessage = Crew alive and well after the mission--congratulations! The interviews will go on for months!

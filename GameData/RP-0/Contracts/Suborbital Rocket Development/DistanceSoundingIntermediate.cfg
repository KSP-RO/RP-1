	title = Downrange Distance LV Development (Intermediate)

	description = Design, build and launch a rocket with @/missionPayload.Print() units of Sounding Rocket Payload to a downrange distance of @/missionDistance.Print() km. For best results, place the sounding payload into a high pressure steel or aluminum tank using the Tank UI in the PAW. <b><color="white">Your rocket must be suborbital (over 140 km) for the contract to be completed. Additionally at least the first 50 seconds of the flight must be done under active guidance (using Near-Earth avionics).</color></b> Perfecting this is part of Launch Vehicle development to utilize a gravity turn and tune your ascent profile and angle of attack. The current distance that your rocket has traveled can be seen in the contract parameters screen. It will update in real time. A better option is to use the MechJeb information called Downrange Distance. It can be added to any window using the Custom Window Editor and is found in the Flight Recorder section.&br;&br;<b><color="green">NOTE: The distance that you see provided by KSP in the F3 screen is not accurate, so please do not base your attempts off of it.</color></b>&br;The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.&br;<b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @expectedDays</b>&br;&br;<b><color="red">This contract will no longer be offered once you complete the First Orbit contract!</color></b>

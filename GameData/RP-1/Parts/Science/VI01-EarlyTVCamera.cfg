//**********************************************************************************
//Explorer VI TV system specifications
//mass: 2.5 lbs [4]
//power consumption: 0.231 W [4]
//very basic (digital) spin-scan camera, uses spinning of spacecraft to draw lines and movement through 
//orbit to advance lines [1]
//takes 64 samples per line, with 8 brightness levels per sample [3]
//A normal image seems to be about 110 lines, which takes 40 minutes to gather [3]
//64*110 = 7040 pixels per image
//8 = 2^3 = 3 bits per pixel
//64*110*3 = 21,120 bits/2640 bytes per image (0.00264 MB)
//About 8.8 bits/s or 1.1 Bytes/s over 40 minutes

//Luna 3 Yenisy-2 Camera system specifications
//film-scan system, 40 exposures
//scanned film at 1000 lines per exposure

	description = The Early Television Camera is used to take images in the visibile wavelength of planetary bodies from space. This is a very early camera and lacks resolution in the images. It is monochromatic, and only capable of distinguishing large features from orbit. Historically, these were flown on Explorer 6, which was the first craft to send images of Earth from orbit, and Luna 3 which was the first craft to return images from the far side of the Moon.

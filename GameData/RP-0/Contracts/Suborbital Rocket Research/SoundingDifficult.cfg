	description = Design, build and launch a sounding rocket with @/missionPayload.Print() units of payload to @/missionAltitude.Print() km. For best results, place the sounding payload into a high pressure steel or aluminum tank using the Tank UI in the PAW.&br;The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.&br;<b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @expectedDays</b>&br;&br;<b><color="red">This contract will no longer be offered once you complete the First Orbit contract!</color></b>

	genericDescription = Deliver a new payload to a specified altitude. This contract will stretch your capabilities and enable harder contracts.

	synopsis = Launch a sounding rocket with @/missionPayload.Print() units of payload to @/missionAltitude.Print() km.

  title = Pacific Telecommunications - Level 2
  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The first generation telecommunications satellite network has proven successful. However, demand is growing for satellite communication, and more countries want dedicated satellite links. Provide simultaneous links between North America, Japan, the Republic of China, Hong Kong and Australia.<br><br>Historical example: Intelsat III series satellites (151kg, Delta-M).

  notes = Additional satellite Earth stations have been constructed in Paumalu (Hawaii, USA), Brewster Flats (Washington, USA), Yangmingshang (Taipei City, ROC), and Hong Kong Stanley (Hong Kong Island, UK). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 5 links at the same time, plus the previous level 1 services. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.

  synopsis = Provide transpacific multi-access two-way telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = Regular telecasts are now possible between North America, Japan, the Republic of China, Hong Kong and Australia.

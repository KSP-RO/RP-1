  title = (PLACEHOLDER CONTRACT) Canadian Remote TV - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>The Canadian government has called for the establishment of a commercial, domestic satellite system to provide telecommunications services throughout the nearly 10 million square kilometers (4 million square miles) of Canada extending across six time zones. Hundreds of small towns, hamlets and clusters of isolated communities in northern areas have very limited communications. Satellite service offers a way for TV and radio programs to be distrubuted to remote communities in the Canadian north.<br><br>Historical example: Anik A series satellites (544kg, Delta 1914).

  notes = New TV Recieve-Only (TVRO) satellite earth stations have been constructed in communities across the Canadian shield. These basic stations have no tracking capability, so you will need to aim them at a point in the sky and ensure a satellite is always within their field of view. The TV feed will be provided from Allan Park satellite earth stations. <br><color=orange>Author's note: TVRO stations currently function like any other ground station. This contract is just a placeholder until TVRO support is added.</color>

  synopsis = Provide remote telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = The Canadian domestic telecommunications network can now provide national TV and radio service to hundreds of communities across the Canadian shield.

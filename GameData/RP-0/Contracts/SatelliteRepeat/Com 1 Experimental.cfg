{
	name = EarlyComSat
	title = Experimental Communications Satellite
	group = ComSats

	description = We have proven the technology to build and operate a functional communications satellite. It is time to develop and launch a series of broadcast communications satellites to test different relay applications, such as transmission of television pictures, telephone calls, telegraph images, and live transatlantic television feeds.<br><b>The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload to operational control after being placed sucessfully in orbit.</b><br>This is a series of four contracts, of which @index have been completed.<br>Real life examples: TelStar 1, 2
	genericDescription = Put a communications satellite into the requested orbit.

	synopsis = Launch an experimental communications satellite into the proper orbit

	completedMessage = Success! We are learning more about space communications with every launch and successfully relaying through space new firsts in broadcast communications.

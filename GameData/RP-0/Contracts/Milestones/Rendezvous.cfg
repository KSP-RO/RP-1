	description = As crazy as the idea sounds, we want to have two separate spacecraft meet up in space. Using your knowledge of orbital mechanics, bring two craft to within 500 meters of each other while in orbit around Earth. Note that you only have a limited time to build and launch the vessels, so don't accept this contract until you are ready!

	synopsis = Perform the First Rendezvous of two craft in space

	completedMessage = Congratulations! By accomplishing the first rendezvous, it opens up the possibilities of what we can do while in orbit.

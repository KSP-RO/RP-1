The bureau designed 170 projects of which 94 were made in series. In total, 45,000 MiG aircraft have been manufactured domestically, of which 11,000 aircraft were exported. The last plane which Gurevich personally worked on before his retirement was the MiG-25, which first flew in 1964.

When looking into high-altitude flight, he calculated that the speed required to produce enough lift for a airplane to stay aloft would be the same as orbital speed at 82 kilometers altitude. This was then rounded to 100 kilometers and is why the Karman line is considered the boundary of space.

        #rp1LeadersKorolev = Sergei Korolev
        #rp1LeadersKorolevDesc = Sergei Korolev worked in Soviet rocketry from 1945 until his death in 1966. He was the USSR's lead rocket engineer throughout the space race, designing everything from the Sputnik missions to Gagarin's flight and the Luna probes. He also began work on the massive N1 Moon rocket, though he died before testing began. He was criticised for letting his rivalry with Vladamir Chelomey get in the way of his work and his design approach was blamed for the failure of the N1. Still, it was well-deserved when he was twice honored as Hero of Socialist Labour, the highest award for cultural and industrial accomplishments in the Soviet Union. Considering they sent him to the Gulag in 1938 on false charges, this was the least they could do.

        #rp1LeadersKraft = Chris Kraft
        #rp1LeadersKraftDesc = Christopher Columbus Kraft Jr. was an American aerospace and NASA engineer who was instrumental in establishing the agency's Mission Control Center and shaping its organization and culture.

She invented the liquid fuel Hydyne in 1957, a 60/40 mix of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and diethylenetriamine that offered a significant performance advantage over ethanol. Because it would be pared with liquid oxygen, she thought Bagel would be a fun name, which would lead to engines being described as using Bagel-LOX. Unfortunately, the U.S. Army rejected this whimsical name. Hydyne powered the Jupiter-C rocket that launched the United States' first satellite, Explorer 1.

        #rp1LeadersNarayanan = Nambi Narayanan
        #rp1LeadersNarayananDesc = Nambi Narayanan is an Indian aerospace engineer who was responsible for leading the team that acquired the technology for the Viking engine from the French and indigenizing it into the Vikas engine, which is used extensively by ISRO to this day.

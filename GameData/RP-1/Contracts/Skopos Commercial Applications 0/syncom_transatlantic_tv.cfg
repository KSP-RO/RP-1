  title = Experimental Transatlantic Telephony
  // Mostly pilfered from NASA SP-32 p. 740.
  description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>For a transatlantic satellite telecom system to be viable, it must provide a sustained link, not just a few minutes until the satellite passes below the horizon. Provide a transatlantic connection that supports a few voice channels for at least 12 hours a day. The lower required data rate should allow a very small satellite to be used, opening up the possibility for higher orbits.<br>Historical example: Syncom 2 (39kg, Thor-Delta).

  synopsis = Provide transatlantic telephony for three months with 50% availability (~12 hours per day).

  notes = Earth stations with cutting-edge antennas have been built at Andover (Maine, USA) and Pleumeur-Bodou (Britanny, France). It should be possible to establish a transatlantic link with a very small satellite.\nThe experimental transatlantic transmissions are mutually exclusive; while you must provide support for both westward and eastward television broadcasts, your satellite does not need to have the capacity for those to happen at the same time.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a transatlantic link via satellite, paving the way for a commercial operating system.

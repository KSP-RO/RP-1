So you want to try Neph's Quarterly Budgets?
1)  Install NQB:

  * Go here and download the latest release: https://github.com/nepphhh/RP-0/releases
  * Delete your /GameData/RP-0 folder.
  * Replace it with the /GameData/RP-0 folder from that git.
  
2) Install SepInteg KCT:

  * Download the latest release from here: https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/KCT/releases
  * Delete your /GameData/KerbalConstructionTime folder.
  * You know what to do by now, right?
  
3) Update RealismOverhaul:

  * Download this: https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul
  * Same as above.
 
That's it!
 
Changes from normal RP-1 include but are not limited to:

  * You earn reputation, which gives you a budget four times a year. More reputation = more money.
  * Revamped early game contracts, the sounding rocket era less sucky.
  * Completely redesigned satellite contracts. More difficult, more rewarding, and more interesting. Now fully integrated with kerbalism. 
  * There are more and cheaper building upgrades. Total building costs have been halved across the board.
  * KCT rate upgrades are twice as cheap but half as powerful.
  * You have two tech queues and can research multiple things at the same time.
  * You get new VAB lines upon your first, fourth, and ninth upgrades, for four VAB lines total!
    
NQB comes packaged with the latest Kerbalism. Kerbalism modifies science such that experiments take time to be completed, life supprot is realistic, and power management is an actual consideration. When you start running an experiment, it will collect science until it completes the experiment or the situation changes, returning fractional science rewards the while time. 

If an experiment is left incomplete, you will still collect that partial science, and you can return again and keep working on the experiment until all science has been collected. This means if you collect the science from a 10 minute flying high experiment in ten one-minute portions, it's the same full data as if you did it all in one go.

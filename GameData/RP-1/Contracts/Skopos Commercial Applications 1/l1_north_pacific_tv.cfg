  title = North Pacific Telecommunications - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: First Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The ability to relay television, voice and facsimile transmissions across the Pacific ocean has proven useful.

  notes = Satellite Earth stations with cutting-edge antennas have been built at Jamesburg (California, USA) and Ibaraki (Ibaraki prefecture, Japan). Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.

  synopsis = Provide transpacific two-way telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = Regular telecasts are now possible between Japan and North America.

		// ** Mercury

		// ** Venus
		//general
		VenusInSpaceHigh = The odd rotation of the planet is easily seen from such an altitude. You inform mission control of your discovery.
		VenusInSpaceHigh = The cloud layer looks almost featureless at this altitude.
		VenusInSpaceLow = The thick clouds obscure your view of the surface.
		VenusFlyingHigh = Thunder rattles the capsule. A storm appears to be going on.
		VenusFlyingHigh = It appears to be raining some kind of acid at this altitude. You begin to worry.
		VenusFlyingLow = You peer through the windows but see nothing but yellow fog. A thunderclap rattles your capsule.
		VenusSrfLanded = The immense pressure makes the hull of your spacecraft groan

		//Mountains
		VenusSrfLandedMountains = 

		//Canyons
		VenusSrfLandedCanyons = The pressure is immense. The interior of your spacecraft has become noticeably smaller than it was in orbit.

		//Lakshmi Planum
		VenusFlyingLowLakshmiPlanum = The ground beneath seems to have been pushed up by some unknown force. 
		VenusSrfLandedLakshmiPlanum = 

		//Fortuna Tessera
		VenusSrfLandedFortunaTessera = 

		//Volcanic Rise
		VenusFlyingLowVolcanicRise = Flying concerningly low above the craters, you wonder whether the volcano is still active or not.

		VenusSrfLandedVolcanicRise =  

		//Highlands
		VenusInSpaceLowHighlands = You spot some lightning dancing across the cloud tops.

		//Midlands
		VenusFlyingLowMidlands = The haze makes it difficult to see the ground. You hope you can land somewhere that's not volcanically active

		//Lowlands




		// ** Earth
		// No reports here, srf science disabled.



		// ** Moon
		//general
		MoonInSpaceHigh = Staring at the crater-filled surface of the Mun you are suddenly thankful for the Earths thick atmosphere.
		MoonInSpaceHigh = In addition to the rather round craters, there also appear to be areas that are far more irregular in shape. The scientists are calling these 'mare'.
		MoonSrfLanded = 

		//Lowlands

		//Highlands
		MoonSrfLandedHighlands = 

		//Midlands
		MoonInSpaceLowMidlands = Despite being relatively flat, the Midlands is still littered with debris from impact ejecta, making choosing a landing site a non-trivial matter.
		MoonSrfLandedMidlands = 

		//Lunar Seas

		//Major Craters
		MoonInSpaceLowMajorCraters = You don't know if the crater rims would be a good landing site. Probably not, but they would certainly be... interesting.
		MoonSrfLandedMajorCraters = 

		//Far Side Basin
		MoonSrfLandedFarSideBasin = 

		//North Pole
		MoonSrfLandedNorthPole = 
		//South Pole
		MoonSrfLandedSouthPole = 


		// ** Mars
		//general
		MarsInSpaceHigh = You can only just see the two moons of Mars in the distance.
		MarsInSpaceLow = There appear to be dust storms billowing across the surface.
		MarsSrfLanded = Very small piles of fine grain red dust are being deposited on the windows by the thin atmosphere.
		MarsFlyingHigh = It looks like there are dust devils meandering across the surface.

		//Olympus Mons
		MarsInSpaceLowOlympusMons = The mountain seems to extend into space itself.

		//North Ice Cap
		MarsInSpaceHighNorthIceCap = The ice cap appears to have spirals in it.
		MarsSrfLandedNorthIceCap = 

		//South Ice Cap
		MarsSrfLandedSouthIceCap = 

		//Major Craters
		MarsInSpaceLowMajorCraters = As you gaze through the window and the red light is dancing across your camera lens you notice big craters on the surface of Mars. Like eyes they stare back at you, you wonder what impact created them. Werner once said something about them being very old, but you don't care. you grab your camera and take a few pictures.
		MarsInSpaceLowMajorCraters = You can see the big craters below you as you zip past, their edges appear to be rough, almost like gashing wounds on the surface, as if the planet was hit by a whole lot of projectiles. You feel reminded of the origin of the name Mars.
		MarsFlyingHighMajorCraters = You look out of the window as you move through the atmosohere with almost no resistance, the only thing that would give away that you are actually surrounded by gas are the sounds of your spaceship wizzing through the atmosphere. The craters below you look daring, almost like target practice. You have a closer look: the craters walls are very steep, too steep for a rover, tgere are almost no rocks in the center of the crater but a lot of sand accumulated there over time and formed wave like patterns, reminding you of the beaches at home.
		MarsFlyingLowMajorCraters = You take a look out the window, the crater seems so close now. You reach out for it's walls, but your mittened hand bumps into the cold glass. No time for games now, concentration. 

		//Lowlands 
		MarsSrfLandedLowlands = 

		//Valles Marineris
		MarsSrfLandedVallesMarineris = 

		//Midlands
		MarsSrfLandedMidlands = 

		//Higlands
		MarsSrfLandedHighlands = 


		// ** Phobos
		//Craters
		PhobosSrfLandedCraters = 

		// ** Jupiter
		//general
		JupiterInSpaceHigh = The planet seems to rotate much more rapidly than Earth.

		//Great Red Spot
		JupiterGreatRedSpot = The atmosphere flows turbulently around the storm, but the vortex itself appears fairly smooth.


		// ** Io
		//general
		IoInSpaceHigh = Io looks like a moldy clump of cheese from up here.
		IoInSpaceLow = It looks very dry down there.

		// ** Europa
		//general
		EuropaInSpaceHigh = Brown streaks and spots blemish the otherwise white surface of the moon.
		EuropaInSpaceLow = The surface looks much smoother than you expected.

		//Lineaments
		EuropaInSpaceLowLineaments = You wonder if these lines were made by aliens or by the underground oceans.

		// ** Ganymede
		//general
		GanymedeInSpaceHigh = You can already tell that Ganymede is much larger than Earth's Moon.
		GanymedeInSpaceLow = Many of the craters appear much lighter in color than the surrounding terrain.

		// ** Callisto

		// ** Saturn
		//general
		SaturnInSpaceHigh = Saturn looks magnificent from out here.

		// ** Mimas
		
		// ** Titan
		//Water
		
		// ** Pluto
		PlutoInSpaceHigh = Pluto and Charon look like a double planet from out here. Sometimes you can't tell which is which.
		PlutoInSpaceLow = Seen from up close, Pluto looks far more interesting than previously thought.

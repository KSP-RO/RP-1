	description = Now that we are familiar with the effects of spaceflight on small animals, it's time to thing bigger. Launching monkeys, dogs, and other large mammals will prepare us for the monumental task of putting an astronaut into space. Carry a large biological capsule and @payload units of monitoring instrumentation in near space, then recover the experiment. You will need to stay above 140 km for at least three minutes to make the required observations before jettisoning the payload, if desired.<br>This is a series of six contracts, of which @index have been completed. After series completion, crewed suborbital contracts will become available.
	genericDescription = Put an advanced biological experiment and a new scientific payload above 140 km for three minutes and recover the experiment and payload safely.
	synopsis = Launch and recover an advanced biological capsule and @payload units of scientific equipment from over 140 km
	completedMessage = Well done! The dog/monkey was safely returned, shaken but otherwise unharmed. Our biologists will examine her to study the effects of the journey.

Design, build, and launch a craft that will successfully place an object in orbit with a perigee of at least 150 km.&br;&br;You can accept other orbit contracts at the same time as this if want to do multiple things on your first orbital launch (for example, you could combine all four starting orbit contracts and launch a solar-powered polar science satellite.

	description = By training and launching a larger mammal in a capsule with recording instruments, we can test how astronauts might perform tasks under similar conditions.  For instance, whether they'll be able to focus under heavy G-loads, vibration, and noise encountered during launch to and recovery from orbit. <br>Carry an advanced biological capsule and @payload units of monitoring instrumentation on a suborbital trajectory, then recover the experiment. <br>This is a series of 3 contracts, of which $SoundingAdvancedBio_Count have been completed.
	genericDescription = Put an advanced biological capsule and some scientific payload on a suborbital trajectory and recover both safely.
	synopsis = Launch a rocket with an advanced biological capsule and @payload units of Sounding Rocket Payload on a suborbital trajectory and recover them.

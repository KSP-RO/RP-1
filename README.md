RP-NQB 0.2.3 Changelog:

  * Added First Guided Rocket contract.
  * Modified some early game contract requirement orders.
  * Made early mission control cheaper, added two more levels.

RP-NQB 0.2.2 Changelog:

  * Overhauled the preorbital phase again. 
    * Remixed SR contracts bigtime:
      * Added Mass Spec SR contracts.
      * Changes to the downrange series should encourage more realistic booster designs instead of RP-NQB 0.2.2a Changelog:
  * Quick fixes:
    * Fixed a bug in the sound barrier contract.
    * Restored proper science costs to plane tech nodes.
    * Pruned a few more non-proc parts from the tree.
  * Added an NQB toolbar icon.clusterbee bumper spam.
      * Replaced High-Altitude SR contracts with Thermosphere Research SR contracts.
      * Simplified Photo SR contracts--ceiling removed.
      * Removed Heavy SR contract series.
      * Genericized SatPayloads so they can be used in SR contracts.
      * Finished Kerbalism integration with science SR contracts.
    * Expanded on plane contracts:
      * Merged PP-1 with KCT airlaunch capability.
      * Added more plane milestones.
      * Expanded existing X-Plane contract series & adapted those from PP-1.
      * Re-enabled and buffed value of suborbital flights.
  * Number of pads again granularly doubled.
  * Completely redid contract organization and gave agencies new handcrafted logos.
  * Bumped the value of the geosync contract.
  * Extended satellite deadlines to at least a year where it was less than a year before. Extended some sounding rocket contracts. 

RP-NQB 0.2.1 Changelog:
Changes from normal RP-1 include but are not limited to:

  * You earn reputation, which gives you a budget four times a year. More reputation = more money.
  * Revamped early game contracts, the sounding rocket era less sucky.
  * Completely redesigned satellite contracts. More difficult, more rewarding, and more interesting. Now fully integrated with kerbalism. 
  * There are more and cheaper building upgrades. Total building costs have been halved across the board.
  * KCT rate upgrades are twice as cheap but half as powerful.
  * You have two tech queues and can research multiple things at the same time.
  * You get new VAB lines upon your first, fourth, and ninth upgrades, for four VAB lines total!
    
NQB comes packaged with the latest Kerbalism. Kerbalism modifies science such that experiments take time to be completed, life supprot is realistic, and power management is an actual consideration. When you start running an experiment, it will collect science until it completes the experiment or the situation changes, returning fractional science rewards the while time. 

If an experiment is left incomplete, you will still collect that partial science, and you can return again and keep working on the experiment until all science has been collected. This means if you collect the science from a 10 minute flying high experiment in ten one-minute portions, it's the same full data as if you did it all in one go.

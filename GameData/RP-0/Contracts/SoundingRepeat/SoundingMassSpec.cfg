	title = Upper Atmospheric Spectrometry 
	genericTitle = Upper Atmospheric Spectrometry
	description = Historically, mass spectrometers have been involved in essentially all aspects of space exploration. From the very first Aerobees to the modern day, sounding rockets have been used as a platform to obtain spectrometry above the atmosphere. Get your space spectrometry program underway by launching a sounding rocket with a mass spectrometer and meterological equipment aboard. You will need to stay above 140 km for at least a three minutese to make and transmit the required observations.<br>This contract may be repeated six times. Currently, @index have been completed. 
	genericDescription = Put a mass spectrometer and a meterological payload above 140 km for at least three minutes.
	synopsis = Launch a mass spectrometer and @payload units of meterological equipment to lowe space
	completedMessage = Well done! Our scientists are now studying the sample to see the effects of the journey.

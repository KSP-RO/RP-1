{		
	name = first_OrbitCrewed	
	title = First Orbital Flight (Crewed)	
	group = HumanMilestones	
	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale	
		
	description = Design, build, and launch into orbit a capsule that contains a human being, then return her/him alive and well to the surface of the Earth. You'll need to complete at least a single orbit (90 minutes) with a perigee above 150km. Note that once you commit to human spaceflight, you have to follow through: this contract has a deadline, and you'll suffer quite the penalty to your budget and prestige if you don't succeed. Make sure you have time to research everything you'll need!	
		
	synopsis = Send a person into orbit and return safely	
		
	completedMessage = Mission Success! This is a most historic day, the first human to orbit the Earth has returned home safely!

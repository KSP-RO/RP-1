	title = First Guided Rocket
	description = Congratulations, you fired off your first rocket. However, more advanced applications of rocketry will require us to have some form of control of the rocket in flight. Ultimately, such control will be required to fly the path required to simultainously clear the atmosphere and accelerate to the velocity required to place a vehicle into orbit. Design, build, and fly a rocket that will demonstrated it posesses sufficient avionics and connectivity to the ground for full control. As a demonstration, fly this rocket 50 km downrange of the launch site.
	synopsis = Fly a guided rocket 50 km downrange
	completedMessage = Nice work. You've shown the uiltity of rockets smarter than a holiday firecracker.

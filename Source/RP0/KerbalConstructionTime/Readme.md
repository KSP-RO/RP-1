#### ABOUT

Kerbal Construction Time is an addon for Kerbal Space Program, a game developed by Squad, that makes rockets/planes/vessels take time to build before you can launch/fly them. The amount of time is based on the cost of all of the parts that make up the craft. This time is reduced when using parts that have been used before, or when using parts that have been recovered from other vessels (meaning there is an advantage to building reusable craft).

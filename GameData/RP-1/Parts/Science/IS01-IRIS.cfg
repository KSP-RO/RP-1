//Mariner 9 IRIS M
//mass: 22.3 kg [9]
//power consumption: 24 Watts [9]
//Michelson interferometer with 4.5 degree FoV. Capable of 4096 samples from a wavenumber of 200 to 2000,
//with 13 bits per sample. [3]
//21 seconds per interferogram [3].
//Data transmitted in realtime at 8.1 kbit/s, could not record onto tape recorder. About 1.5 hours of 
//IRIS data could be taken per day.

//Voyager IRIS
//mass: 19.47 kg [8]
//power consumption: 12 Watts [8]
//Michelson interferometer with 0.25 degree FoV. Capable of 4096? samples from a wavenumber of 200 to 4000,
//with ? bits per sample. [9]
//45.6 seconds per interferogram [9].
//Output data at 1.12 kbit/s? [8]

//This is placed pretty early, shoot for the low side of things
//13 kg, 16 W
//Based on NIMBUS:
//3408 samples * 11 bits per sample = 37,488 bits per interferogram
//37,488 bits * 420 interferograms/orbit * 13 orbits/day * 10 days for global coverage = 2,046,844,800 bits
//2,046,844,800 bits / 6-ish biomes = 341,140,800 bits (42.6 MB)
//Shoot for 10 days to complete I guess. 395 bit/s, (49.375 Byte/s)

	description = The IRIS experiment is used to provide information on the vertical structure, composition, and dynamics of the atmosphere and on the emmissive properties from the surface and atmospheres of planetary bodies in the infrared wavelengths. Historically, these experiments were flown on many craft including NIMBUS 3/4, Mariner 9 and Voyager 1/2 as well as other Earth Satellites.

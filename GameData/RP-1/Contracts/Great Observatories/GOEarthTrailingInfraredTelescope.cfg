	description = <b>Program: Great Observatories<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>With the success of the Infrared Space Observatory, scientists are eager for a more advanced, higher-precision follow-up. Launch an infrared space telescope to a cooler Earth-trailing orbit to study exoplanets, space dust, and spectra of various objects.<br><br><b><color="green">Make sure your craft arrives at a solar orbit that slowly moves away from Earth with an Infrared Space Telescope 3 experiment and enough liquid helium coolant to run it.</color></b><br><br>Historical example: Spitzer Space Telescope.

	synopsis = Launch the first infrared space telescope to solar orbit, and return at least 30 days of science observations.

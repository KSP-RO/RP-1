  title = Experimental Transpacific Television
  description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The development of artificial satellites opens the possibility of applying microwave radio relay technology to transoceanic links, using a “microwave repeater in the sky”. The objective for this experiment is to answer the critical questions, leaving until a later round of design the optimization of trade-offs and the development and construction of a commercial operating system.<br><br>Historical example: Relay 1 (79kg, Thor-Delta).

  synopsis = Provide transpacific television for three months with 1% availability (~15 min per day). Open the Skopos window (pink wave) to view the current connection status.

  notes = Earth stations with cutting-edge antennas have been built in Kashima (Ibaraki prefecture, Japan), and at Point Mugu (California, USA). It should be possible to establish a transpacific link with a very small satellite. Open the Skopos window (pink wave) in the tracking station and select the "show network" button to view their location.\nThe experimental transpacific transmissions are mutually exclusive; while you must provide support for both westward and eastward television broadcasts, your satellite does not need to have the capacity for those to happen at the same time.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a transpacific link via satellite, paving the way for a commercial operating system. Maintain this connection for one year for further testing.

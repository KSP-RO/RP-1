	title = Sustained Mach @mach Flight 
	title = Sustained Supersonic Flight
	description = Design, build and fly a crewed aircraft to fly above mach @mach for two minutes in level flight. Vital to the development of new wing shapes and high-speed aerodynamics (the area rule, swept wings, mach tuck, and so on), breaching the sound barrier is a worthy scientific endeavor. Firsts to break the sound barrier include the U.S. Bell X-1 (1947), the Soviet Lavochkin La-176 (1948), and the British de Havilland DH.108 (1948).
	genericDescription = We want you to set a new atmospheric speed record!
	synopsis = Fly a crewed craft to reach @targetSpeed m/s and maintain for at least 120 seconds.
	completedMessage = Congratulations! You've set a new record for sustained supersonic flight!

	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Launch a satellite into an elliptical orbit with a new cosmic ray detector called a Cherenkov counter.  This device is a different type of cosmic ray detector specifically calibrated for high-energy particles like neutrinos. <br><br><b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains a Cherenkov Counter and return 50% of the available science from High Earth Orbit.  Science does not have to be collected in only 1 flight.</color></b><br><br>Historical example: Explorer 11 (37kg, Juno II)

	synopsis = Launch a scientific satellite into an elliptical orbit with Cherenkov Counter experiment.

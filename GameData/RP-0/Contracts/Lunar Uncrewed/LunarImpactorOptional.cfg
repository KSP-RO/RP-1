	description = Design and successfully launch a probe that impacts the surface of the Moon. Scientists at home will record their observations as a result of the impact. Due to the nature of the experiment, the impactor must have significant mass to it. The contract requires the impactor to have at least a 40 kg mass.<br><br>The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.<br><b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @expectedDays</b><br><br>This is a series of @maxCompletions contracts, of which @index have been completed.
	genericDescription = Impact the surface of the Moon with a probe.

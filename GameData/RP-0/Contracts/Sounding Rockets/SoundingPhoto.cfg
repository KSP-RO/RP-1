	title = Early Downrange Track Photography	
	description = V-2s launched by the U.S. from the White Sand Proving Grounds returned the first images of Earth from space. We need you to test emerging high-altitude photography technology. Design, build, and launch a rocket with a payload of bulky testing and stabilization equipment that will recover film imagery from just above the edge of space. This is a series of four contracts.
	synopsis = Launch a rocket with an early film camera and 250 units of payload that stays between 100 and 180 km for at least three minutes and covers a downrange distance of @targetDistanceKM, then return the film camera
	completedMessage = Excellent! Both the media and our scientists will be excited to see these lovely shots.

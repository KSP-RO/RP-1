	description = Design and successfully launch a craft that can achieve a soft landing on the far side of the Moon and return science data back to Earth.&br;&br;Lunar libration already allows us to see 59% of the Moon's surface, so we want you to land within 80° of the far side.&br;&br;<b><color=white>NOTE: You can not accept this contract and the normal Lunar Lander contract at the same time.</color></b>&br;&br;<b>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / @maxCompletions</b>
	genericDescription = Achieve a soft landing on the far side of the Moon and transmit Science.

	synopsis = Achieve a soft landing on the far side of the Moon and transmit Science

	completedMessage = Mission Success! You have safely landed on the far side of the Moon and returned valuable science data from the surface. We now know that it is possible for a crewed craft to land there safely as well.

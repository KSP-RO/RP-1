	description = <b>Program: Advanced Crewed Orbit<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Performing the first EVA provides valuable insight into future spacesuit, rather than flight suit, design. It also highlights future technologies that need development for EVA. Launch a spacecraft into orbit with least one crewmember aboard, perform a spacewalk while recording observations, and immediately transmit them home. Then, return the crew to Earth after at least one full orbit with a perigee above 150 km. Historically, the first spacewalk was performed from a Soviet Voskhod 2 (1965, 5.7 tons, modified Molniya) followed a few months later by a spacewalk from a U.S. Gemini capsule (1965, 3.8 tons, Gemini Titan II).

	synopsis = Perform a spacewalk during an orbital mission (with report), then return safe.

	completedMessage = A spacewalk, and then a safe return. Excellent work!

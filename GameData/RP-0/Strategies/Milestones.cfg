	article = Reports from our sources inside of the government have confirmed the rumors. Humans have broken through the "sonic barrier", better known as the speed of sound! Some experts thought the barrier could not be broken, but the innovative scientists and engineers, along with brave pilots have proven it to be possible.&br;&br;Historical Information: On October 14th, 1947, US Air Force pilot Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in a Bell X-1 that he nicknamed Glamorous Glennis. The rocket-powered aircraft was dropped from the bomb bay of a B-29 and acheived a speed of Mach 1.06 (361 m/s). The Soviets accomplished the feat in 1948 with a Lavochkin La-176 and the British in 1948 with a de Haviland DH.108.

	description = <b>Program: Early Satellites (Light)<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Design, build, and launch a rocket that will travel 6000 km or more over ground while carrying @/missionPayload.Print() units of Sounding Payload. This challenge will require rather more delta-v than the 4500 km attempt. <b><color="white">Your rocket must be suborbital (over 140 km) for the contract to be completed. @RP0:avionics50sAdvice</color></b> Perfecting this is part of launch vehicle development to tune your ascent profile and develop high-altitude staging methods. The current distance that your rocket has traveled can be seen in the contract parameters in the Contracts App display for this contract. It will update in real time. &br;&br;<b><color="green">@RP0:f3BadAdvice</color></b>

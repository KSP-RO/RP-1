{
	name = first_ComSat
	title = First Passive Communications Satellite
	group = ComSats

	description = Our communications around the globe are limited to line of sight because of the curvature of Earth. Developing a proper communications satellite is a difficult endeavour, but we can begin working on this technology now. We will place a passive communications satellite into an orbit to see if it is possible to transmit a human voice through space over radar. Design and build a passive communications satellite and place it in orbit.<br>Real life examples: SCORE

	synopsis = Launch the first passive communications satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! While faint, we have transmitted the human voice from space for the first time. Further experimentation with communications satellites awaits.

	description = <b>Program: Crewed Spaceplane Development<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>One mission planned for reconnaissance spaceplanes such as Dyna-Soar II was to rendezvous with and investigate satellites on orbit. Using your own knowledge of orbital mechanics, bring two craft to within 100 meters of each other while in orbit around Earth. At least one of the spacecraft must be a newly launched spaceplane which subsequently lands on the runway.&br;&br;<b><color=white>NOTE: You can not select this contract and 'First Rendezvous' at the same time. If you select the other contract while this is active, this will automatically fail.</color></b>&br;&br;<b><color=yellow>NOTE: This contract requires a horizontal landing on the space center runway.</color> If playing from the Cape, the Space Shuttle runway provided by the RSS-CanaveralHD mod is also a valid landing target.</b>

	synopsis = Perform the First Rendezvous of a spaceplane with another spacecraft

	completedMessage = Congratulations! By accomplishing the first rendezvous, it opens up the possibilities of what our spaceplanes can do while in orbit.

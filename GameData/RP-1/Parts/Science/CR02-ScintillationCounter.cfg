	description = The scintillation counter cosmic ray telescope is a combination of three scintillators giving both the energy of a charged particle and its rate of energy loss in the scintillators. It is measuring the mass and energy spectra of primary and solar cosmic rays and electrons. This detailed measurement of charged particles can allow for more detailed analysis of the radiation environments in interplanetary space.

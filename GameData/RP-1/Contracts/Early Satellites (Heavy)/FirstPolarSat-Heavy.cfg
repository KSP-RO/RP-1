	description = <b>Program: Early Satellites (Heavy)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>A polar orbit is one in which a satellite passes above or nearly above both poles of the body being orbited on each revolution. It therefore has an inclination of (or very close to) 90 degrees to the equator. A satellite in a polar orbit will pass over the equator at a different longitude on each of its orbits. Place a satellite weighing at least 400 kg into a polar orbit so we can study the advantages in greater detail.

	synopsis = Launch a satellite into a Polar Orbit weighing at least 400 kg.

	completedMessage = Mission Success! The satellite is orbiting at a high inclination and it is giving our scientists ideas of how we can use this type of orbit.

	description = Design and successfully launch an uncrewed probe to land on Mars, gather science, and bring the science back to Earth. This is a sample return missions so you cannot just transmit the data back, it needs to be physically returned.

	synopsis = Send an uncrewed craft to land on Mars and return the science to Earth.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Our scientists can learn a lot more about the make-up of the planet by studying the physical samples that you have returned.

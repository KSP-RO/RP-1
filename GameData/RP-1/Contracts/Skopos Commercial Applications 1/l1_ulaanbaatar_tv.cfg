  title = Moscow-Ulaanbaatar Television - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: First Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Mongolia is a close ally to the Soviet Union, but much like the eastern territories of the Soviet Union, it is sparsely populated and dominated by rugged terrain. Satellite telecommunication offers a way to easily provide TV to these remote areas.<br><br>Historical example: Molniya 1+ series satellites (1,600kg, Molniya).

  notes = A satellite Earth station has been built at Naran (Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia), just outside Ulaanbaatar; while it has a tracking dish, it is receive-only; television will be broadcast from Moscow.

  synopsis = Provide television service to Ulaanbaatar with 95% availability (~23 h per day) over a 90 days period.

  completedMessage = About half a million viewers throughout Mongolia can now watch 40 hours per week of live colour television broadcasts from Moscow.

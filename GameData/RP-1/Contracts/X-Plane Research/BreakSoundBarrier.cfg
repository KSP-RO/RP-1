	description = <b>Program: X-Plane Research<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Design, build, and fly a crewed aircraft or rocket to attain Mach 1 and hold above it for 30 seconds. Vital to the development of new wing shapes and high-speed aerodynamics (the area rule, swept wings, mach tuck, and so on), breaching the sound barrier is a worthy scientific endeavor. Firsts include the U.S. Bell X-1 (1947), the Soviet Lavochkin La-176 (1948), and the British de Havilland DH.108 (1948).

	synopsis = Fly a crewed craft to reach Mach 1 and maintain for at least 30 seconds.

	completedMessage = BOOM! Congratulations, you have broken the sound barrier!

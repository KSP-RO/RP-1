{
	name = first_OrbitCrewed
	group = Milestones
	
	title = First Crewed Orbital
	
	description = Design, build, and launch into orbit a capsule that contains a human being, then return her/him alive and well to the surface of the Earth. You'll need to complete at least a single orbit (90 minutes) with a perigee above 150km. Note that once you commit to human spaceflight, you have to follow through: this contract has a deadline, and you'll suffer quite the penalty to your budget and prestige if you don't succeed. Make sure you have time to research everything you'll need!
	
	synopsis = Send a person to orbit and return safely.
	
	completedMessage = This is a most historic day, the first spacefarer has returned to Earth!

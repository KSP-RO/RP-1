	description = <b>Program: Crewed Spaceplane Development<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>The goal and realization of putting three (or more) crew on orbit at the same time begins the era of the space shuttle and ready access to LEO. These craft should be able to support at least three crew and prove that they can stay in orbit for @/DurationText days before returning to a runway landing. The U.S. Space Shuttle (1981, STS) performed this mission, while the Soviet Буран (1988, Energia) was designed to do the same but made only one, unmanned, orbital flight before cancellation.&br;&br;<b><color=white>NOTE: You can not select this contract and 'Orbital Flight with at Least Three Crew' at the same time. If you select the other contract while this is active, this will automatically fail.</color></b>&br;&br;<b><color=yellow>NOTE: This contract requires a horizontal landing on the space center runway.</color> If playing from the Cape, the Space Shuttle runway provided by the RSS-CanaveralHD mod is also a valid landing target.</b>&br;&br;<b>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / unlimited</b>

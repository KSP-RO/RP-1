	description = We need you to give Earth its first artificial satellite! Design, build, and launch a craft that will successfully place an object in orbit with a perigee of at least 150km. Once you're in orbit, don't forget to analyze the telemetry and record any other data for scientists to marvel over! You have a time limit, however, and your prestige is riding on the line. If you commit to this, however, your program will receive substantial funding to make the launch possible.
		
	synopsis = Launch the first satellite into orbit of Earth
		
	completedMessage = Congratulations on placing Earth's first artificial satellite in orbit! Our sensors are receiving data from the craft and scientists are poring over the data.

    id = RP0-IonSensingAltitudeControl
    title = Ion Sensing Altitude Control
    baseValue = 30
    scienceCap = 30
    dataScale = 5
    requireAtmosphere = False
    situationMask = 16
    biomeMask = 0
    description = To investigate determination of spacecraft attitude in yaw and pitch from measurement of ion flow variations. The recording of ion sensor outputs during pitch and yaw maneuvers will be compared with data obtained from the inertial guidance system and the horizon scanner. Results of the comparison and the astronaut evaluation will form the basis for further development of simple, lightweight orbital attitude determination systems.<b>This experiment can be completed once. NOTE: This experiment takes 48 hours.</b>

    RESULTS
    {
        default = Using special ion sensors on the craft, it allows our crew to determine their speed with improved accuracy.

	group = EarlySatellites
	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = Through measuring the Doppler shift of radio signals transmitted from a satellite in a known orbit, it is possible for a receiver on the ground to establish their location, which would have many applications both civilian and military.  To test the principle and develop receiver equipment, it is necessary to have a test navigational satellite in orbit.  Be sure to include solar panels and/or an RTG to generate power.  Historically, the first experiments in satellite navigation were made with Transit 1B (119kg, Thor-Ablestar).

	synopsis = Launch the first navigation satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite is in orbit and we have already begun to receive Doppler curves.

	description = The Early Television Camera is used to take images in the visibile wavelength of planetary bodies from space. This is a very early camera and lacks resolution in the images. Historically, these were flown on Explorer 6, which was the first craft to send images of Earth from orbit, and Luna 3 which was the first craft to return images from the far side of the Moon.

	description = Design, build and launch a crewed rocket or plane to put a person into the high atmosphere above @/altHighCrew.Print() km and return home safely. Optionally, landing back at the runway will pay out extra funds. If playing from the Cape, the Space Shuttle runway provided by the RSS-CanaveralHD mod is also a valid landing target.<br>After completing this contract, the required altitude will increase to @/nextAltHighCrew.Print() km.<br>This contract has been completed $CrewedReachSpace_Count times.
	genericDescription = Design, build and launch a crewed rocket or plane to put a person into high atmosphere above a specific altitude and return home safely.

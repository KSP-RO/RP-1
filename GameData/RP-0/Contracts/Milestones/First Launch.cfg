Just design and build a vessel, roll it out to the pad, turn up the throttle, and stage to take off! (And note all the records to break in the 'Active Contracts' tab. They update, so keep checking.)

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Your space program is off to a great start. Now it is time for some "rocket science" as you need to continue to go higher, faster, and farther.

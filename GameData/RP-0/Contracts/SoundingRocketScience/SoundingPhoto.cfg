	title = Early Downrange Track Photography
	description = V-2s launched by the U.S. from the White Sand Proving Grounds returned the first images of Earth from space. We need you to test emerging high-altitude photography technology. Design, build, and launch a rocket with a payload of bulky navigational and stabilization equipment that will aim the camera and recover film imagery from just above the edge of space.<br>This is a series of five contracts, of which @index have been completed.
	genericDescription = Launch a film camera downrange at low altitude and recover it.
	completedMessage = Excellent! Both the media and our scientists will be excited to see these lovely shots.
	synopsis = Loft an early film camera and 250 units of navigational payload to @altitude km on a trajectory that covers a downrange distance of @distance km, then return the film camera

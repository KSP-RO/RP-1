He is known for designing some of the best engines the world has ever seen, including the RD-107/108, the most powerful rocket engine ever built, the RD-170, and the RD-253 used on the Proton Rocket. His major fault was not believing that hydrolox was a suitable propellant for a space engine.

He was the USSR's lead rocket engineer throughout the space race, designing everything from the Sputnik missions to Gagarin's flight and the Luna probes. He also began work on the massive N1 Moon rocket, though he died before testing began. He was criticized for letting his rivalry with Vladamir Chelomey get in the way of his work and his design approach was blamed for the failure of the N1. Still, it was well-deserved when he was twice honored as Hero of Socialist Labour, the highest award for cultural and industrial accomplishments in the Soviet Union. Considering they sent him to the Gulag in 1938 on false charges, this was the least they could do.

Because it would be pared with liquid oxygen, she thought Bagel would be a fun name, which would lead to engines being described as using Bagel-LOX. Unfortunately, the U.S. Army rejected this whimsical name. Hydyne powered the Jupiter-C rocket that launched the United States' first satellite, Explorer 1.

In 1956 he took a job with Rolls-Royce as their Chief Rocket Propulsion Engineer. Under his guidance the development of the RZ.2 and RZ.20 took place, built to power the Blue Streak missile. Both were considered highly advanced engines at the time and they went on to power the first stage of Europa 1.

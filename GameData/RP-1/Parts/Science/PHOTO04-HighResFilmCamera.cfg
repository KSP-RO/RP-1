	description = The High Resolution Film Camera is used to take photographs of planets from space. This camera provides very high resolution photographs that can be transmitted back to Earth, but some fidelity is lost. It is still recommended to physically return them. Historically, these were flown as Spy Satellites under the KH-9 Hexagon name, but for RP-1, these represent the first high resolution satellite cameras from commercial companies.

	description = The MIMS was an improvement on the Bennett Radio version. These had miniaturized magnetic sector field instruments and the mass resolution was much higher than the Bennett RF spectrometer. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Historically, these experiments were flown on Explorer 31, AE-C, and other Earth Satellites.\n\nThe science can be transmitted for full recovery. Level 2 Mass Spectrometry Experiment. Can gather 50% of Mass Spectrometry Science.

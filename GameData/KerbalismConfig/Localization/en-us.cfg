		// ********** Part: kerbalism-activeshield
		#kerbalism-activeshield_Part_description = Generate a magnetic field around the vessel, reducing incoming radiation. The effect is significant only in relation to the radiation levels encountered in interplanetary flight, and will do little to nothing inside super-charged particle belts or during solar storms.
		#kerbalism-activeshield_Part_manufacturer = TripleZeta Workshops
		#kerbalism-activeshield_Part_title = Active Shield

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-antenna
		#kerbalism-antenna_Part_description = Designed long ago by a young and inspired Wernher von Kerman, before his focus shifted to the development of weapons of mass destruction.
		#kerbalism-antenna_Part_manufacturer = Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics
		#kerbalism-antenna_Part_title = Communotron 8

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-chemicalplant
		#kerbalism-chemicalplant_Part_description = A versatile chemical plant that can fit in the small service bay. Any similarities with the Convert-O-Tron is purely coincidental.
		#kerbalism-chemicalplant_Part_manufacturer = Rookies Inc.
		#kerbalism-chemicalplant_Part_title = Chemical Plant

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-container-inline-0625

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-container-inline-125
		#kerbalism-container-inline-125_Part_description = One of the guys at JPL had a simple and brilliant idea: bigger containers to store more supplies. After a couple thousands man-months and 300M in fundings, the prototype was ready for early testing.

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-container-inline-250
		#kerbalism-container-inline-250_Part_description = After the extravagant excesses of the previous generation of space-grade supply containers, the fiscal department wasn't very happy of funding development of an even bigger one. When one of the clerks complained about the rationale behind 'putting men in space for the sake of it', JPL switched to war-mode and blackmailed all bureaucrats involved into submission. And the project was approved in the earnest.

		#kerbalism-gravityring_Part_title = Gravity Ring

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-greenhouse
		#kerbalism-greenhouse_Part_description = Grow crops in the deeps of space or on the surface of some desolate rock.
		#kerbalism-greenhouse_Part_manufacturer = TripleZeta Workshops
		#kerbalism-greenhouse_Part_title = Greenhouse

		// ********** Part: kerbalism-lifesupportmodule
		#kerbalism-lifesupportmodule_Part_description = Seeing the lack of ECLSS redundancy, mission control urgently ordered us to convert this chemical plant to an external ECLSS module. Guaranteed to explode only 147.28% as often as the original.
		#kerbalism-lifesupportmodule_Part_manufacturer = Lambda Aerospace
		#kerbalism-lifesupportmodule_Part_title = External ECLSS Module

	description = Design and successfully launch an uncrewed probe to land on an Asteroid, gather science, and bring the science back to Earth. This is a sample return missions so you cannot just transmit the data back, it needs to be physically returned.&br;&br;Don't forget that in order to "land" on an Asteroid in KSP terms, you need to have a grappling hook and attach yourself to one.

	synopsis = Send an uncrewed craft to land on an Asteroid and return the science to Earth.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Our scientists can learn a lot more about the make-up of the asteroids by studying the physical samples that you have returned.

	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Launch a satellite into an elliptical orbit with a new cosmic ray detector called a Cherenkov counter.  This device is a different type of cosmic ray detector specifically calibrated  for high energy particles like neutrinos.&br;&br;<b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains a Cherenkov Counter and returns 1-week's worth of science from High Earth Orbit.</color></b>&br;&br;Real life examples: Explorer 11.

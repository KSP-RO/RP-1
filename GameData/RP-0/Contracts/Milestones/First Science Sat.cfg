	description = Just putting an object in orbit is a stunt. Getting valuable scientific data from it is far more impressive.&br;&br;With the data returned from our sounding rockets, interesting radiation has been observed. We need you to send a scientific satellite into an eccentric orbit in order to study this data with more accuracy. Based on the best guesses of our scientists, having an apoapsis over 1,500 km with a low periapsis will help us to learn more about the radiation surrounding Earth.&br;&br;<b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains a Cosmic Ray Science experiment (Geiger-Muller Counter or Scintillation Counter) as we will need science returned.</color></b>&br;&br;Real life examples: Object D (Sputnik 3), Explorer 1.&br;&br;<b>Accepting this contract will automatically accept the First Artificial Satellite contract as well.</b>

	synopsis = Launch a Scientific Satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth with Cosmic Ray Science Experiments

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite you sent into orbit has returned extremely valuable data that has proven the existence of the Van Allen Radiation Belts.

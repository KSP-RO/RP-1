	description = Design, build, and launch a space station into orbit of Mars and then crew it for a month with at least two crew, and bring the crew safely home. Once you're done, you'll get missions to perform further crew rotations and resupply missions, as well as expansion or replacement missions.&br;&br;Don't forget that the transfer window to Mars is often around 2 years. Make sure you bring enough Life Support to last long enough for a resupply mission to get there.

	synopsis = Launch a Space Station into Martian Orbit and crew it for a month

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Your space station is now in orbit around Mars and the first crew has put it through the shake-out process.

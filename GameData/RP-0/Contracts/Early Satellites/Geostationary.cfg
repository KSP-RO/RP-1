	description = A geostationary orbit is a circular orbit 35,786 km above the Earth's equator and following the direction of the Earth's rotation. An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period of 23h 56m 4.1s and thus appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers. \n\nLaunch a satellite into a Geostationary Orbit.

	synopsis = Launch a satellite into a Geostationary Orbit

	completedMessage = Success! The Geostationary orbit is the most commonly used orbit for communications satellites and other observation satellites.

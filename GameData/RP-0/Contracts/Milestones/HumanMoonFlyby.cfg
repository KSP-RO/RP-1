	name = first_MoonFlybyCrewed

	title = Crewed Lunar Flyby
	
	description = Design, build, and launch a crewed spacecraft into lunar space (with a periselene under 5000km) and return safely to Earth. Note that once you commit to going to the Moon, you have to follow through: this contract has a deadline, and you'll suffer quite the penalty to your budget and prestige if you don't succeed. Make sure you have time to research everything you'll need!
	
	synopsis = Send a human being into lunar space and return safely.
	
	completedMessage = Crew alive and well after the mission--congratulations! The interviews will go on for months!

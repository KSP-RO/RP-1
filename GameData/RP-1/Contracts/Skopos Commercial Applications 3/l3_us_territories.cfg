  title = US Remote Territories Telecommunications - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico are isolated from the continental United States by hundreds of miles of ocean or rugged terrain, rendering communications between them and the continental United States expensive and difficult using terrestrial methods. Several corporations have expressed interest in using the domestic US satellite network to establish reliable, high data-rate communications with their remote offices located in these areas. However, some modifications may be required to ensure a stable connection can be established with ground stations far from the continental US.<br><br>Historical example: Western Union Westar series satellites (574kg, Delta 2914), RCA Satcom series satellites (868kg, Delta 3914), AT&T Comstar series satellites (1,516 kg, Atlas-Centaur D).

  notes = New privately-owned satellite earth stations have been constructed in Campo Rico (Puerto Rico), Talkeetna (Alaska), and Paumalu (Hawai'i). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support multiple links between these stations.

  synopsis = Provide domestic multi-access two-way telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = Privately operated satellite earth stations can now relay messages across to the remote territories of the United States, and dozens of customers have already leased channels.

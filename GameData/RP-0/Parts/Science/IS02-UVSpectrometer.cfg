	description = The UV Spectrometer experiment is used to provide information on the vertical structure, composition, and dynamics of the atmosphere and on the emmissive properties from the surface and atmospheres of planetary bodies in the ultraviolet wavelengths. Historically, these experiments were flown on many craft including Mariner 10.\n\nThe science can be transmitted for full recovery. Level 2 Imaging Spectrometry Experiment. Can gather 50% of Mass Spectrometry Science.

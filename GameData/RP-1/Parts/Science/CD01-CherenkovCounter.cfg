//**********************************************************************************
//  Cherenkov Detector CRT
//
//	Based on the Cherenkov Counter Cosmic Ray Telescopes used on many spacecraft
//  for more detailed study of the Cosmic Energy particles.
//	Based on the IMP/OGO-1 cosmic ray telescope????
//
//	Part originally created by CobaltWolf as the Pioneer 10 Cosmic Ray Telescope
//
//**********************************************************************************

//I have no idea what this was originally based on, the only instrument of roughly appropriate size, era and type in SP-3028 is the IMP/OGO-1
//scintillation counter cosmic ray telescope.
//This is not quite right, but close enough???

	description = The Cherenkov detector is another type of high energy particle detector, using a Cherenkov detector in combination with a scintillation detector to further observe and characterize high-energy gamma rays.  It measures the arrival directions and energies of gamma rays and highly-energetic charged particles from cosmic radiation. This detailed measurement can allow for more detailed analysis of the radiation environments in interplanetary space.

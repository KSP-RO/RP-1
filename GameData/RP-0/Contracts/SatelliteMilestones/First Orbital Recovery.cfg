	description = Reentry is brutally hot and dangerous but it can be survivable with the right technology and equipment. We want you to design, build, and launch a craft that can survive a reentry and make a soft landing or splashdown on Earth. Note that orbital-speed suborbital flights are acceptable as well. Historically this research started with weapon reentry vehicles for the newly developing ICBM forces but the research, and rockets, were quite applicable elsewhere; reconnaissance satellite recovery vessels, crewed capsules, and interplanetary landers have also withstood this crucible.

	synopsis = Recover a craft from orbit

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The craft has survived reentry, and engineers are examining it very keenly indeed.

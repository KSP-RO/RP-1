Ideal of analyzing the atmospheric composition of unknown environments. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Historically, these simple experiments were flown on interplanetary crafts including the Mars Viking Lander and Cassini.\\nLevel 4 Mass Spectrometry Experiment Device.

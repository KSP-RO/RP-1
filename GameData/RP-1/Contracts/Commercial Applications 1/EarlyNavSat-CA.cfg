	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>The First Navigation Satellite contract proved that measuring signals from a satellite is an effective method for determining position data on the surface of the Earth. Expand on this capability to create the first rudimentary satellite-based precision location network. At least 3 satellites are required to locate a position on a sphere, with a fourth necessary to determine vertical position. Launch at least 4 more navigation satellites into polar orbits.<br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color></b><br><br><b>The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.<br><b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @RP0:expectedDays_EarlyComSat<br>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / unlimited</b>
	genericDescription = Put a satellite with the required amount of navigation satellite payload into the desired orbit.

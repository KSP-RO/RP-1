	title = Low Space Biological Experimentation	
	description = Launching small mammals will prepare us for the monumental task of putting an astronaut into space. Carry a small biological capsule and @payload units of monitoring instrumentation above the Karman line, then recover the experiment. You will need to stay above 100 km for at least a full minute to make the required observations before jettisoning the payload, if desired. This is a series of four contracts; after series completion, crewed suborbital contracts will become available.
	genericDescription = Put a biological experiment and a new scientific payload above 100 km for sixty seconds and recover the experiment and payload safely.
	synopsis = Launch and recover a biological capsule and @payload units of scientific equipment from over 100 km
	completedMessage = Well done! Our scientists are now studying the sample to see the effects of the journey.

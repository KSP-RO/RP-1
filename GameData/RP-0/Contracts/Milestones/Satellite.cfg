	description = We need you to give Earth its first artificial satellite! Design, build, and launch a craft that will successfully place an object in orbit with a perigee of at least 150km. Once you're in orbit, don't forget to analyze the telemetry and record any other data for scientists to marvel over! You have a time limit, however, and your prestige is riding on the line. If you commit to this, however, your program will receive substantial funding to make the launch possible.
	
	synopsis = Place an object in Earth orbit and record data.
	
	completedMessage = Our sensors are receiving data from the craft. Congratulations on placing Earth's first artificial satellite in orbit! Scientists are now poring over the data.

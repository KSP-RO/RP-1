	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = Design, build, and launch a crewed spacecraft into lunar space (with a periselene under 5000km) and return safely to Earth. Note that once you commit to going to the Moon, you have to follow through: this contract has a deadline, and you'll suffer quite the penalty to your budget and prestige if you don't succeed. Make sure you have time to research everything you'll need!

	synopsis = Launch a crewed ship to Flyby the Moon

	completedMessage = Crew alive and well after the mission--congratulations! The first humans to have seen the Moon from up close, this is an historic day!

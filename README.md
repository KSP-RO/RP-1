Welcome to Realistic Progression Zero, the lightweight career addon for Kerbal Space Program's Realism Overhaul.

RP-0 is a career mode for RealismOverhaul with minimal install requirements, and with fair and balanced gameplay. Our aim is to allow players to enjoy RealismOverhaul in career mode, without installing a huge number of modules on top of those required by RealismOverhaul itself. However we also wish to ensure that RP-0 works with as many additional mods as possible; we use the Community Tech Tree for the basis of career progression, and try to place as many parts from other mods as possible in a balanced fashion without them being requirements.

RP-0 is a community effort, and your contributions are appreciated. You can report issues [on our issues page](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0), and access the [source code on github](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0). The [tech tree](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/blob/master/tree.yml) itself is designed to be particularly easy for humans to edit.

When starting the game, the balance should be similar to KSP's normal career, so we recommend "Moderate" or "Hard" settings, though you might want to keep science progression at a higher value than Hard's default. If playing without part unlock costs, it's recommended you drop contract funds payouts to 20% to maintain balance, since in real life the research programs and the setting up of factories cost much more than serial production.

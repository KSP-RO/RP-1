	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Communications around the globe are limited to line of sight because of the curvature of Earth. If we can launch a communications satellite into orbit, we can use it to transmit information to the opposite side of the world.<br><br>Historical example: Telstar 1 (78kg, Thor-Delta)<br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color>

	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Anyone that has ever used a compass is familiar with the magnetic fields that encapsulate Earth.  Launch a satellite to better charaterize the strength and direction of the magnetic field, and determine how far into space its influence is felt.&br;&br;<b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains a Magnetic Scan experiment.  Launch it into an elliptical orbit and return 1-days worth of science from both Low and High Earth Orbit.</color></b>&br;&br;Real life examples: IMP-A.

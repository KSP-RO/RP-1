  title = Indian Ocean Telecommunications - Level 2
  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The first generation telecommunications satellite network has proven successful. However, demand is growing for satellite communication, and more countries want dedicated satellite links. Provide simultaneous links between Europe, Pakistan, Africa, Thailand and Australia.<br><br>Historical example: Intelsat III series satellites (151kg, Delta-M).

  notes = Additional satellite Earth stations have been constructed in Fucino (Abruzzo, Italy), Raisting (Bavaria, Germany), Si Racha (Chonburi, Thailand), Logonot (Rift Valley Province, Kenya), and Deh Mandro (Sindh, Pakistan). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 5 links at the same time, plus the previous level 1 services. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.

  synopsis = Provide transpacific multi-access two-way telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = Regular telecasts are now possible between the Indian Ocean region, Australia and Europe.

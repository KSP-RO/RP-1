  // Mostly pilfered from NASA TM X-70435 p. 11-1.
  description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>For the Soviet Union, which occupies about one-sixth of the earth’s surface, an efficient system of space communications is a vital necessity. The country covers nearly 11,000 km from east to west and over 7,200 km from north to south, and is crossed by 11 time zones; in addition, there are tremendously varied climatic conditions and vast areas of rugged terrain.<br><br>Historical example: Molniya 1-1 (1,600kg, Molniya).

  synopsis = Provide two-way television for three months with 1% availability (~15 min per day) between Moscow (Moscow Oblast, USSR) and Vladivostok (Primorsky Krai, USSR).

  notes = Earth stations with large tracking antennas have been built in Moscow and Vladivostok.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a space communications network for the Soviet Union, paving the way for an operational system.

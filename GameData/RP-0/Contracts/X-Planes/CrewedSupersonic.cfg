	description = Design, build and fly a crewed jet aircraft to maintain @VesselGroup/HoldSituation/minSpeed m/s in level flight, then return home safely. Optionally, landing back at the runway will pay out extra funds. If playing from the Cape, the Space Shuttle runway provided by the RSS-CanaveralHD mod is also a valid landing target.<br>This is a series of 17 contracts, of which $RP0_XPSS_Difficulty have been completed.<br>The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.<br><b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @expectedDays</b>

	description = <b>Program: Early Satellites (Heavy)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Just putting an object in orbit is a stunt. Getting valuable scientific data from it is far more impressive.&br;&br;With the data returned from our sounding rockets, interesting radiation has been observed. We need you to send a scientific satellite into an eccentric orbit in order to study this data with more accuracy. Based on the best guesses of our scientists, having an apoapsis over 1500 km with a low periapsis will help us to learn more about the radiation surrounding Earth.&br;&br;<b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains an Advanced Biological Capsule Part and has a mass of at least 400 kg.</color></b>&br;&br;Real life examples: PS-2 (Sputnik 2)

	synopsis = Launch a Bio Satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth with an Advanced Biological Capsule.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite you sent into orbit has returned extremely valuable data.

	description = Design, build and launch a sounding rocket with @payload units of payload to a downrange distance of @targetDistanceKM km. This is a series of six contracts; after the series completion, heavy rocket development contracts will become available.
	genericDescription = Deliver a new payload a specified distance downrange. This contract will stretch your capabilities and enable harder contracts.
	synopsis = Launch a sounding rocket with @payload units of payload to a downrange distance of @targetDistanceKM km.

	description = Create a craft (or series of crafts) to RADAR map the surface of Venus. Be sure to look at the information available for each scanner to determine the best altitude to scan. This contract is based on the real life missions of the Venera and Pioneer Venus Orbiter missions. Upon completion of this contract, you will be offered another contract to map the remaining surface of Venus.&br;&br;The Pioneer Venus Orbiter used a highly elliptical orbit with a 24-hour period.

	synopsis = Perform a partial Low Resolution Altimetry survey of Venus.

	completedMessage = Mission Success! This early mapping survey will be very valuable to the scientists on Earth looking to learn more about the surface makeup of Venus.

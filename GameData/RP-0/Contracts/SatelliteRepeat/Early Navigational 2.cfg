	group = NavSats

	description = We are ready to begin our first operational navigational network. Thanks to the data provided from our prototypes, we have determined that a high polar orbit, in which a satellite passes above or nearly above both poles of the body being orbited on each revolution, is the optimal orbit for maximum spatial and temporal coverage. We therefore must launch our satellites into an inclination of (or very close to) 90 degrees to the equator. The navigitional satellies will pass over the equator at a different longitude on each of its orbits.	<br><b>The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload to project control after being placed sucessfully in orbit.</b><br>This contract may be repeated four times. Current @index have been completed.</b>Real life examples: Transit 5-series
	genericDescription = Put an early navigation satellite into the requested orbit.

	synopsis = Launch an early navigational satellite into the proper orbit

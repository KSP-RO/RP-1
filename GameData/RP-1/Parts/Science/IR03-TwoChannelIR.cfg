//**********************************************************************************
//Mariner 6/7 Infrared Radiometer
//mass: 3.75 kg [5]
//power consumption: 3 Watts [5]
//2x cassegrain telescopes, one each for 8-12 micron and 18-25 micron channel with 0.7x0.7 degree FoV fixed to spacecraft frame and scanned by 
//movement of the spacecraft, with a 3-position mirror in the beam path to allow the detectors to view open space or a calibration target instead.
//photovoltiac sensors are sampled at 200 Hz, with a 63-second scan time. [5]

//Mariner 9 Infrared Radiometer
//mass:
//power consumption:
//Identical to Mariner 6/7, but with improved telescope glare shielding, reducing FoV to 0.53x0.53 degrees[6]
//On Nadir orbits, only UV spectrometer or infrared radiometer data could be transmitted at 50 bps rate [7]

//Mariner 10 Infrared Radiometer
//mass: 3.52 kg [4]
//power consumption: 2.7 Watts (max) [4] 2.5 Watts (average) [1]
//2x cassegrain telescopes, one each for 11 micron and 45 micron channel, fixed to spacecraft frame and scanned by movement of the spacecraft.
//FoV 1.1 degrees at 45 micron, 0.5 degrees at 11 micron. Instrument took 42 second frames concurrent with TV system, with 
//35 words/frame/channel and 10 bits/word.
//35 words/frame * 2 channels * 10 bits/word / 42 seconds = 16.7 bits/second
//Due to short duration of Mercury flyby, only about 12 pairs of measurements were gathered per flyby.

//Actually use Mariner 69' as a basis for this, Mariner 10 had very short Mercury flybys heavily constraining it, also so there's actually
//something in the 69-71 node.
//I can't find any good data on Mariner 69' or 71', and Mariner 10 was heavily compressed and simplified.
//Say full 50 bps (6.25 Bps) for data rate, and 2.4 MB total data (twice IR02)?

	description = The two-channel infrared radiometer observes and records the thermal emissions from planetary bodies in two broad spectral bands. If correlated with pictures and other instruments, this could help detect surface features like mountains, valleys, and volcanoes. Historically, this experiment is based on the one flown on Mariner 10.

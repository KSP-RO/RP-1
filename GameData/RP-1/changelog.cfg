	{
		version = 2.4.0.0
		versionKSP = 1.12.3
		CHANGE
		{
			change = Programs and Contracts
			subchange = Implement major/minor program support - Programs now cost Slots, and different levels of the Admin building give different total slots. Major programs take more slots than minor programs, which makes taking minor programs less of a net-negative
			subchange = Reduce confidence cost of Breakneck to be only 2x Fast
			subchange = Retune the reputation gain from completing a program early to better reflect the tradeoff
			subchange = Better tune confidence gains from optional contracts in later programs

		{
			change = UI
			subchange = Change instances of build in the UI to integrate since what happens with rockets/planes is integrating them, they are presumed to arrive at the space center built. (Yes, this is strange for very early rockets, please bear with us until a manufacturing system is added to RP-1).
			subchange = Show an estimate on the net difference in salary for integrating a vessel, along with its time and its rollout cost and time. Note that this (along with time) is only an estimate and does not reflect efficiency gain over the course of integrating the vessel. This is net difference in salary because idle engineers aren't free, and this salary cost is not added to rollout cost because it is assumed the engineers would otherwise be occupied anyway when rolling out the vessel
			subchange = Show total tooling cost and total unlock credit available in the KCT window in the editor
			subchange = Properly refresh Electricity mass in the Proc Avionics window when changing SM tank type on a proc avionics part -- Requires RF v15.6
			subchange = Add a tooltip to the Plans window when mousing over a vessel name to show its cost
			subchange = Fix completed optional contracts from completed programs not showing the confidence they granted when looking at them in the Mission Control archives tab
			subchange = Let players choose to use the latest screenshot instead of an automatic screenshot when creating and showing a Newspaper article. The setting is in the ingame RP-1 UI. By @pap1723 
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			change = Other Changes
			subchange = Move the various Sep Motors into Early Solids
			subchange = Increase the rep cost of changing leaders
			subchange = Change Easy and Normal rep multipliers to be more in line with the current rep balance. NOTE: It is recommended players new to PLC (RP-1 v2.x) play on Normal, not Moderate.
			subchange = Tooling now uses the Unlock Credit system along with parts and upgrades
			subchange = Fix an issue where recovered planes would claim to not fit in the hangar when being launched or airlaunched due to an issue with RealChute and its size reporting
			subchange = Fix Restock Plus stock fairings being included as supported
			subchange = Add minSubjectsToComplete attribute to CollectScience parameter
			subchange = Log individual maintenance components & many more costs

	{
		version = 2.0.0.0
		versionKSP = 1.12.3
		CHANGE
		{
			change = Notes
			subchange = This update is entirely incompatible with existing saves; it is SAVE-BREAKING. To prevent accidental save-breaking, it is not offered as an upgrade in CKAN. In order to upgrade to it, either create a new Express install, or uninstall the Express Install and then reinstall it. When given the choice make sure to select the regular RP-1 option, not Legacy RP-1.
		}
		CHANGE
		{
			change = Overview
			subchange = Programs is a new way of playing RP-1, where contracts are grouped into overarching Programs. Use the Administration Building to select your starting Program(s) and go from there. You will only have access to the contracts appropriate to your current Program(s), and those contracts will only reward rep (and sometimes Confidence, a new currency). Income comes from your programs' budgets, though you also get a large subsidy (towards salary and other maintenance costs). This subsidy increases year-over-year until the mid-60s, and varies based on your current reputation.
			subchange = The existing VAB/SPH build queues are replaced with Launch Complexes. The player can have any number of launch complexes, and LCs have size, mass and resource limits. The Hangar is a special case of LC.
			subchange = You can now appoint (and fire) certain historic Leaders. These leaders offer bonuses and penalties, and new slots unlock as you advance in your career.
			subchange = For a longer overview, see

	description = Launching small mammals will prepare us for the monumental task of putting an astronaut into space. Carry a small biological capsule and @payload units of monitoring instrumentation above the Karman line, then recover the experiment. For best results, place the sounding payload into a high pressure steel or aluminum tank using the Tank UI in the PAW. <br>This is a series of 3 contracts, of which $SoundingBio_Count have been completed.
	genericDescription = Put a biological experiment and a new scientific payload above the Karman Line and recover the experiment and payload safely.
	synopsis = Launch and recover a biological capsule and @payload units of scientific equipment from over @/altitudeKm km
	completedMessage = Well done! Our scientists are now studying the sample to see the effects of the journey.

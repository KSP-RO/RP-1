	group = WeatherSats

	description = Geostationary satellites provide the best views of the clouds in specific areas for our meteorologists. Place a weather satellite in geostationary orbit near the marked area. This contract can be completed up to 6 times.&br;&br;<b><color=red>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color></b>&br;&br;<b>Number of Contracts Completed: $GEOWeather_Count</b>
	genericDescription = We have a customer requesting a new Communications Satellite. Design a satellite within their specs and launch into an orbit with the proper orbital parameters as outlined in the contract.&br;&br;This contract can be completed as many times as you would like. The orbits will be chosen randomly from Tundra, Geostationary, Molniya and Geosynchronous orbits.&br;&br;<b><color=red>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.

	synopsis = Launch a geostationary weather satellite to the marked area

	completedMessage = Success! By placing the weather satellite in a geostationary orbit, we can see the movement and formations of the clouds.

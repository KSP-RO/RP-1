	description = Just putting an object in orbit is a stunt. Getting valuable scientific data from it is far more impressive.&br;&br;With the data returned from our sounding rockets, interesting radiation has been observed. We need you to send a scientific satellite into an eccentric orbit in order to study this data with more accuracy. Based on the best guesses of our scientists, having an apoapsis over 1,500 km with a low periapsis will help us to learn more about the radiation surrounding Earth. We also want you to determine the threat of micrometeorites to satellites, so make sure to bring that instrumentation too.&br;&br;Real life examples: Object D (Sputnik 3), Explorer 1.
		
	synopsis = Launch a Scientific Satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth
		
	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite you sent into orbit has returned extremely valuable data that has proven the existence of the Van Allen Radiation Belts.

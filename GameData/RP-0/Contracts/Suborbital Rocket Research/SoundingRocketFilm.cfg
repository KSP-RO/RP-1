	genericTitle = Low space film return
	description = V-2s launched by the U.S. from the White Sands Proving Grounds returned the first images of Earth from space. We need you to test emerging high-altitude photography technology. Design, build, and launch a rocket with a payload of bulky testing and stabilization equipment that will recover film imagery from just above the edge of space.<br>This is a series of 3 contracts, of which $SoundingFilm_Count have been completed.
	genericDescription = Launch a film camera downrange at low altitude and recover it.
	completedMessage = Excellent! Both the media and our scientists will be excited to see these lovely shots.
	synopsis = Launch a rocket with an early film camera above @/altitudeKm km and cover a downrange distance of @targetDistanceKM km, then return the film camera.

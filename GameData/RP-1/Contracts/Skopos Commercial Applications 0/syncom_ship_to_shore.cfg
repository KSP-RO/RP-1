  title = Experimental Ship-to-Shore Communications
  // Mostly pilfered from NASA SP-32 p. 740.
  description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Satellite communications offers the ability to communicate with nearly any point on Earth, including the oceans. A ship equipped with a satellite terminal could be provided a reliable radio link to shore in nearly any condition, bypassing many of the difficulties involved in communicating with a vessel at sea. However, this will require a satellite terminal small enough to fit on a ship.<br>Historical example: Syncom 2 (39kg, Thor-Delta).

  synopsis = Provide ship-to-shore communications for three months with 50% availability (~12 hours per day). Open the Skopos window (pink wave) to view the current connection status.

  notes = The USNS Kingsport has been fitted with a satellite earth station, and is stationed in the Gulf of Guinea, off the western coast of Africa. The Kingsport also has a VHF command and telemetry antenna that, if provided with a link to Andover (Maine, USA) by communication satellite, will be able to relay data from scientific satellites. Open the Skopos window (pink wave) in the tracking station and select the "show network" button to view their location.\nThe experimental ship to shore transmissions are mutually exclusive; while you must provide support for both westward and eastward broadcasts, your satellite does not need to have the capacity for those to happen at the same time.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a ship-to-shore link via satellite, paving the way for a commercial operating system.

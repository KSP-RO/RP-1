  title = Intersputnik - Asia - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>We have successfully deployed satellite communications across the Union. However, we would also like the ability to directly broadcast to other Soviet-aligned states. The Intersputnik International Organization of Space Communications would like to bring satellite communications technology to Soviet allies in Central and Southeast Asia.<br><br>Historical example: Raduga/Gran series satellites (2,000kg, Proton-K Blok-DM).

  notes = In addition to Naran (Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia), ground stations have been built in Kabul (Kabul Province, Afghanistan), Lao (Vientiane province, Laos), Phủ Lý (Ha Nam Ninh, Vietnam) and Pyongyang (Pyongyang Directly Governed City, DPRK). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 5 links at the same time. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.

  synopsis = Provide television service to Soviet-aligned states with 95% availability (~23 h per day) over a 90 day period.

  completedMessage = Live television broadcasts from Moscow can now be viewed in Soviet-aligned states across southern Asia.

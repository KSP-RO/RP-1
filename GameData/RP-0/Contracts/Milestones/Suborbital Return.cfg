	description = As early as 1947 the U.S. was launching fruit flies into space on suborbital trajectories and recovering them, but it wasn't until 1951 that a monkey named Yorick and eleven mice were successfully recovered from an Aerobee flight. The Soviets preferred dogs and returned many from suborbital flights, the first two being Dezik and Tsygan in 1951 on top of an R-1. Although it is not a requirement to launch a biological capsule for this mission, it is a perfect opportunity to do so. Send a rocket out of the atmosphere (140km) and return at least some of the craft back to Earth, intact, for study.

	synopsis = Return a suborbital spacecraft safely to Earth

	completedMessage = Well Done! Our scientists are now studying the sample to see the reactions from the journey.

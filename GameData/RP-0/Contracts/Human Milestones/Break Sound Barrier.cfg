{
	name = BreakSoundBarrier
	title = Break the Sound Barrier (Crewed)
	group = HumanMilestones
	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = Design, build and fly a crewed aircraft or rocket to attain 350 meters per second. Vital to the development of new wing shapes and high-speed aerodynamics (the area rule, swept wings, mach tuck, and so on), breaching the sound barrier is a worthy scientific endeavor. Firsts include the U.S. Bell X-1 (1947), the Soviet Lavochkin La-176 (1948), and the British de Havilland DH.108 (1948).

	synopsis = Fly a crewed craft to reach 350 m/s

	completedMessage = Boom! Congratulations, you have broken the sound barrier!

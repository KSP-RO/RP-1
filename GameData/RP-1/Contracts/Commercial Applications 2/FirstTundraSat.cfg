	description = <b>Program: Advanced Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>A Tundra orbit is a highly elliptical geosynchronous orbit (note: not geostationary orbit) with a high inclination (usually near 63.4) and an orbital period of one sidereal day. A satellite placed in this orbit spends most of its time over a chosen area of the Earth, a phenomenon known as apogee dwell. The ground track of a satellite in a tundra orbit is a closed figure eight. The orbit in this contract is actually using data from the Sirius satellites, the only known satellites using a Tundra orbit.<b>
	synopsis = Launch a test satellite into a Tundra Orbit

	completedMessage = Success! The Tundra orbit is highly eccentric and lets the satellite spend most of its time over a point in the high latitudes.

	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br><b>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>A Molniya orbit is a type of highly elliptical orbit with an inclination of 63.4 degrees, an argument of perigee of -90 (270) degrees, and an orbital period of one half of a sidereal day. This orbit will cause the satellite to appear to remain nearly stationary in the sky for a short period at apogee. Combined with the high inclination, this orbit will allow a satellite to maintain a line of sight with satellite earth stations at a high latitude for about 6 hours a day.<br><br>See the RP-1 wiki for more information on how to get to a Molniya orbit.<br><br>Historical example: Molniya 1-1 (1,600kg, Molniya)

	synopsis = Launch a satellite into a Molniya orbit

	completedMessage = Success! The Molniya orbit is highly eccentric and allows the satellite to spend most of its time over the high latitudes.

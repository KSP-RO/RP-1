  title = Maritime Satellite Communications - Level 3
  //mostly from The MARISAT System [12]
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Maritime mobile communications on the high seas in the HF radio band suffer from the inherent limitations of signal propagation. Continuous, real-time, highly reliable communication to ships on the high seas is not available today, with an average message taking 12 hours to reach a ship at sea. With the power of satellite communications, we would like to provide reliable telephone and teletype service to the high seas.<br><br>Historical example: Marisat series satellites (362kg, Delta 2914).

  notes = New satellite earth stations have been constructed at Southbury (Connecticut, USA) and Santa Paula (California, USA) to serve as command centers for ships at sea. Ships across the western hemisphere have been provided with compact, low-power satellite terminals to communicate with our satellite network. These terminals are much less capable than previous ground-based satellite earth stations, and will require a more powerful satellite to establish a reliable link.

  synopsis = Provide ship-to-shore communications for one month with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = Ships across the western hemisphere can now call home at any time with a satellite terminal as small as a file cabinet.

  // ************ REWARDS ************
  prestige = Trivial       // 1.0x
  rewardReputation = 325    //Kinda hard. Ship terminals are weaker, and ships are positioned in the Atlantic and Pacific, but it should be possible to piggyback off existing infrastructure.

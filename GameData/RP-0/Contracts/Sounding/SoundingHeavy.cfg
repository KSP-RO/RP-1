	description = Developing early orbital launch vehicles is hard. As your space program matures, you will need to test new heavy engines and develop vehicles capable of putting larger payloads into orbit. Design, build and launch a heavy sounding rocket with @payload units of payload to a downrange distance of @targetDistanceKM km.<br>This is a series of six contracts, of which @index have been completed.
	genericDescription = Deliver a new payload a specified distance downrange. This contract will stretch your capabilities and enable harder contracts.
	synopsis = Launch a heavy sounding rocket with @payload units of payload to a downrange distance of @targetDistanceKM km.
	completedMessage = Congratulations on a successful launch! The rocket has delivered the payload.

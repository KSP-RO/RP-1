	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The satellite launched in the Early Satellites program returned valuable data about the space near Earth.  Send a satellite to High Earth Orbit to detect cosmic rays so that we may better ascertain the shape and strength of the cosmic ray environment around Earth.&br;&br;<b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains a Cosmic Ray Science experiment (Geiger-Muller Counter or Scintillation Counter) and an Early TV camera and return 1-day's worth of Cosmic Ray Science from High Earth Orbit.</color></b>&br;&br;Real life examples: Explorer 6.

	synopsis = Launch a Scientific Satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth with Cosmic Ray Science experiment and an Early TV camera.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite you sent into orbit has returned extremely valuable data that has helped characterize the cosmic ray environment around Earth.

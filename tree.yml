    # Parachutes
    # The *cost* here is not used when building ships, because RealChute
    # provides procedural pricing. Instead, it *is* used when recovering
    # stages. Since a spent parachute is worthless, these are all zero.
    #
    # TODO: We could do with stanzas that activate if RealChute is not
    # installed, to provide fixed pricing for these.

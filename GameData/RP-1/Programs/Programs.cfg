	description = An Earth space station will enable long-term human exploration of space and provide benefits to people of Earth. This Program tasks you with launching and maintaining Space Stations in Earth orbit and continuously crewing them with an increasingly longer stay durations. By completing the program, you will prove that long-term space habitation is possible which will open up crewed explorations of Venus, Mars, and beyond. NOTE: This program isn't functional enough to be completed and only has two unique contracts. Both of those contracts are also very buggy and may not complete even if the requirements should have been met.

	description = Jupiter presents many opportunities for exploration, but also many challenges: it requires almost the same amount of energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. Gravity assists can be used to save delta-v at the cost of flight duration. Once there, a rich and diverse system awaits any explorer. Along with the largest planet in the Solar System, the Jovian system is also home to the largest moon, Ganymede, a planetary-mass moon. This program will send uncrewed scientific probes to Jupiter and its moons.<br><br>Historically, Jupiter is the most-visited outer planet, with 9 missions having completed flybys or entered orbits, most notably by the Voyager missions in 1979 on their flybys towards the outer Solar System, and by the Juno orbiter whose mission continues today. Most recently, ESA's JUICE mission departed in 2023 enroute to the Galilean moons.

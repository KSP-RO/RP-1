	description = <b>Program: X-Plane Research<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Future airliners may fly at unprecedented altitudes, and it is important to understand atmospheric behavior such as turbulence at high altitudes. In order to do this, design, build, and fly a crewed jet aircraft to maintain @VesselGroup/HoldSituation/minAltitude meters in level subsonic flight, then return home safely. Optionally, landing back at the runway will award extra reputation. If playing from the Cape, the Space Shuttle runway provided by the RSS-CanaveralHD mod is also a valid landing target.

	genericDescription = Design, build, and fly a crewed jet aircraft to maintain a specific altitude, then return home safely.

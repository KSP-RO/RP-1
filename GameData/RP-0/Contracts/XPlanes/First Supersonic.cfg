	title = Break the Sound Barrier
	description = The sound barrier or sonic barrier is the sudden increase in aerodynamic drag and other undesirable effects experienced by an aircraft or other object when it approaches the speed of sound. When aircraft first began to be able to reach close to the speed of sound, these effects were seen as constituting a barrier making faster speeds very difficult or impossible. Begin your X-planes program by breaking the sound barrier and achieving supersonic flight.
	synopsis = Fly a plane faster than 343 m/s.
	completedMessage = Congratulations! You've flown a pilot faster than any human before and inagurated your X-planes program.

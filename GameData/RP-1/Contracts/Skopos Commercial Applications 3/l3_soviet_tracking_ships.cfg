  title = Soviet Tracking Ships - Level 3
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>We would like to create "Ground stations at sea", ships equipped with high-gain antennas to relay data from manned and unmanned scientific spacecraft. However, a ship at sea cannot have a landline connection to mission control, and existing HF radio systems are unreliable and low quality. Instead, these ships have had a satellite communications terminal installed, allowing them to relay data back to mission control via communications satellites.<br><br>Historical example: Raduga/Gran series satellites (2,000kg, Proton-K Blok-DM).

  notes = The tracking ship NIS Sergi Korolev has been positioned in the Atlantic near Uruguay. If it is provided with a link to shore, it will be able to use it's high-gain antenna systems to function as a ground station. This ship is south of the equator, and so may prove difficult to connect to existing Soviet communications networks.

  synopsis = Provide ship-to-shore communications for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = Telemetry can now be relayed from tracking ships to mission control.

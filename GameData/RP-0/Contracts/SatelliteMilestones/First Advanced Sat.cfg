	name = first_AdvancedSat
	title = First Advanced Satellite
	group = Milestones

	description = Our early attempts at useful satellites have been worthwhile, but we need to figure out how to keep a satellite functioning for more than a few days. Many science experiments have a high power draw. Figuring out how many batteries we need for a satellite is a good start, but as we get more complex, we need ways to fulfill greater energy needs. The first way we can do that is to generate power so we don't have to rely on only batteries.<br><b>Make sure your craft carries solar panels to survived in space for an extended time and carries a magnetometer, as we will need science returned.</b><br>Contract completion is required for development of more advanced meteorological, communications and navigational satellites.<br>Real life examples: Vanguard 3.

	synopsis = Launch a solar powered scientific satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth with magnetic scan experiments		

	completedMessage = Success! This is an important step in increasing the usefulness of our satellites in orbit.

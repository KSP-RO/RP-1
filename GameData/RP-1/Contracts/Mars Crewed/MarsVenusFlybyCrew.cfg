	description = <b>Program: Crewed Mars Exploration<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>To reduce total radiation exposure to Crew, a gravity assist from Venus has been proposed as part of an Opposition-Class missions to the Red Planet. This trajectory also reduces the overall Delta-V requirements neeeded for a faster interplanetary transfer compared to a direct-to-Mars approach.

	synopsis = Perform a Venus Flyby during the outbord or inbound leg of the Mars journey during an Opposition-class mission. This contract can be performed during the optional Mars Flyby contract, or as part of the required Mars Orbit.

	completedMessage = Congratulations on leveraging the gravitational pull of Venus! You have demontrated the use of a gravity assist to reduce delta-V requirements for a mission craft.

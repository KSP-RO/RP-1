//**********************************************************************************
//Nimbus 1 HR infrared radiometer
//mass: 5.13 kg [1/5]
//power consumption: 4 Watts [1/2/5]
//Whisk-broom scanning mirror spins at 44.7 RPM, sweeping 122. Line advance is achieved by spacecraft movement, resulting in a continuous 
//strip being scanned beneath the spacecraft path, with an instantaneous FoV of ~0.5 degrees. A single photocell is used which 
//is sensitive at 3.5-4.2 microns. [3]
//Data output is analog, but contains "about 100 levels" [5], with a bandwidth of 280 Hz. It is recorded onto one channel of a 4-track tape
//recorder at 3.75 inches/second, then played back at 30 inches/second.
//Round 100 levels to 128 for an even 7 bits (for diagnostic data, housing temp readings, etc.)
//7 bits * 280 Hz * 0.34 (mirror facing into space/back of housing for 2/3rds of travel) = 666 bit/s = 83.3 Byte/s

//Nimbus was a weather sat, took continuous measurements. Instrument was intended to be used at night, but took usable readings in daylight too.
//To prevent data requirements from getting too absurd (this is a 1964 instrument after all), set target total scan time to about 1 day (HRIR took
//very wide swathes and could image the entire earth at decent resolution in one full day).
//24 hours / ~6 biomes per planet = ~4 hours per biome * 83.3 Byte/s = ~1.2 MB per biome

This can be useful for weather forecasting. Historically, this experiment is based on the ones flown on the NIMBUS satellites.

He was responsible for many key advances in aerodynamics, notably on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization. He is regarded as an outstanding aerodynamic theoretician of the 20th century. When looking into high-altitude flight, he calculated that the speed required to produce enough lift for a airplane to stay aloft would be the same as orbital speed at 82 kilometers altitude. This was then rounded to 100 kilometers and is why the Karman line is considered the boundry of space.

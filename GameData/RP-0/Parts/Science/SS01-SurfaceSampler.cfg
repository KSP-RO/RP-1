	description =  The soil mechanics surface sampler is an instrument designed to test the physical properties of the topsoil (density, porosity, resistivity) and to expose subsoil material for photography. Historically, this experiment is based on the one flown on the Surveyor missions.\n\nThe science can be transmitted for 25% recovery, but can be returned for full value.

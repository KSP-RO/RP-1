	description = Crewed suborbital flights are used as a safer prelude to an orbital mission, for research, or to set non-orbital altitude records. Send any number of crew above @altitude meters to satisfy the requirements of this mission. Historical missions used the Mercury capsule (1961, Mercury-Redstone), the X-15 (1963, B-52), and SpaceShipOne (2004, White Knight).<br>This is a series of four contracts, of which @index have been completed. 
	genericDescription = Launch a crewed spacecraft or spaceplane with at least one person aboard into a suborbital trajectory of at least the given apogee and return safely home.
	synopsis = Send a crewed vessel on a suborbital flight
	completedMessage = Congratulations! The crew has returned safely and we put another person in space.

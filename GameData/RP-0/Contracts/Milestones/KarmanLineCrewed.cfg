CONTRACT_TYPE
{
    name = first_KarmanCrewed
	group = Milestones
    
	title = Pass the Karman Line (crewed)
    
    description = The Karman line is the line at which the speed necessary to maintain altitude via lift is the same as the speed required for orbit. It's the traditional dividing line between the atmosphere and space (despite their being nonzero pressure well above it, Earth's atmosphere extends quite far indeed). We want you to send someone above it! Note that once you commit to human spaceflight, you have to follow through: this contract has a deadline, and you'll suffer quite the penalty to your budget and prestige if you don't succeed. Make sure you have time to research everything you'll need!
    
	synopsis = Pass the Karman line with a crewed craft.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The first person in space!

  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>The Canadian government has called for the establishment of a commercial, domestic satellite system to provide telecommunications services throughout the nearly 10 million square kilometers (4 million square miles) of Canada extending across six time zones. As the first stage of this system, satellite links should be established across the populated areas in the southern portion of Canada. This nearly 5,000 kilometer (3,000 mile) strip of land along the US-Canada border contains the majority of the Canadian population, and a satellite telecommunications should allow TV and voice circuits to be quickly routed from one side of the country to the other.<br><br>Historical example: Anik A series satellites (544kg, Delta 1914).

  notes = New satellite earth stations have been constructed in Lake Cowichan (British Columbia), Hugget (Alberta), Belair (Manitoba), Allan Park (Ontario), and Harrietsfield (Nova Scotia). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 4 links at the same time.

  synopsis = Provide domestic multi-access two-way telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = The Canadian domestic telecommunications network can now relay several TV channels and hundreds of voice circuits from Vancouver Island to Nova Scotia.

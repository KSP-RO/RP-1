	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Taking photographic images of Earth's surface from space, with a powerful enough lens, can provide highly detailed information about many things.  When used for intelligence purposes, an eye in the sky is an invaluable tool for gathering information about geopolitical rivals, but these types of satellites have numerous peaceful purposes as well, including crop monitoring, observing deforestation, and providing indicators for areas requiring humanitarian aid. <b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains an Improved Film Camera, and a system to return the film canister for processing.</color></b>&br;&br;Real life examples: CORONA/Keyhole-1.

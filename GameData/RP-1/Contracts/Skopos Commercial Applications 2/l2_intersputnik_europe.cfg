  title = Intersputnik - Eastern Europe - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>We have successfully deployed satellite communications across the Soviet Union. However, we would also like the ability to directly broadcast to other Soviet-aligned states. The Intersputnik International Organization of Space Communications has been formed to bring satellite communications technology to Soviet allies in Europe.<br><br>Historical example: Molniya 3 series satellites (1,740kg, Molniya-M).

  notes = New satellite Earth stations have been built in Neustrelitz (Bezirk Neubrandenburg, DDR), Sedlec-Prčice (Central Bohemian Region, Czechoslovakia), Taliándörögd (Veszprém County, Hungary), Cheia (Prahova County, Romania) and Plana (Sofia City Oblast, Bulgaria). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 5 links at the same time. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.

  synopsis = Provide television service to Soviet-aligned states with 95% availability (~23 h per day) over a 90 days period.

  completedMessage = Live television broadcasts from Moscow can now be viewed in Soviet-aligned states.

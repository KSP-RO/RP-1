Originally LA5 was a rocket launch site which supported a number of British experimental launches, including the United Kingdom's first, and as of 2015 only, satellite launch. It consisted of three separate launch pads, which supported 22 Black Knight sounding rocket launches, and four Black Arrow carrier rocket launches. Of the four Black Arrow launches, two were orbital launches, the first of which, on 2 September 1970, failed, and the second, on 28 October 1971, succeeded, placing the Prospero satellite into low Earth orbit.

Taiyuan sits at an altitude of 1500 meters and its dry weather makes it an ideal launch site. Confusingly, U.S. intelligence designates TSLC the 'Wuzhai Missile and Space Test Centre", despite the fact that the town of Wuzhai is located a considerable distance from the Taiyuan space launch facility. The site is primarily used to launch meteorological satellites, earth resource satellites and scientific satellites on Long March launch vehicles into sun-synchronous orbits. TSLC is also a major launch site for ICBMs and overland Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) tests. The site has a sophisticated Technical Center and Mission Command and Control Center. It is served by two feeder railways that connect with the Ningwu-Kelan Railway.

The launchpad is situated at 31°53'04″N 34°40'49″E  This ensures that rocket debris falls into water, and that the rocket does not fire over regional neighboring countries near Israel that could use the technology.

The shape of the area leased is an ellipse, measuring 90 kilometres (56 mi) east-west by 85 kilometres (53 mi) north-south, with the cosmodrome at the centre. It was originally built by the Soviet Union in the late 1950s as the base of operations for its space program.

Omelek was planned to host launches for the upgraded Falcon 1e rocket, but as of 2012, SpaceX stopped development on the Falcon 1e launches while it focused on its large Falcon 9 launch manifest.

Originally developed as an ICBM site for the R-7 missile, it also served for numerous satellite launches using the R-7 and other rockets. Its high latitude makes it useful only for certain types of launches, especially the Molniya orbits, so for much of the site's history it functioned as a secondary location, with most orbital launches taking place from Baikonur, in the Kazakh SSR. With the end of the Soviet Union, for Russia Baikonur became foreign territory which charged usage fees, so Plesetsk has seen considerably more activity since the 2000s.

Vostochny is a Russian spaceport on the 51st parallel north in the Amur Oblast. Svobodny was a Russian rocket launch site located at 51 degrees north in the Amur Oblast. The cosmodrome was originally constructed as a launch site for intercontinental ballistic missiles called Svobodny-18. It was initially selected as a replacement for Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, which became independent as Kazakhstan after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However the development of Svobodny was subsequently ended in 2007 in favour of a totally new space port, the Vostochny Cosmodrome. The breakup of the Soviet Union left their primary cosmodrome at Baikonur in a foreign country, Kazakhistan. Studies for a far-east location closer to the latitude of Baikonur started, and initially settled on the existing missile base at Svobodny. This was located near the railway station of Ledyanaya, and had been used for several decades by the 27th rocket division of Strategic Rocket Forces. On March 1, 1996 President Yeltsin issued a decree formally declaring the site as a cosmodrome.

Since the end of the Apollo program in 1972, LC-39 has been used to launch every NASA human space flight, including Skylab (1973), the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (1974), and the Space Shuttle program (1981-2011). KSC also has a facility which was used for landing the reusable Space Shuttle orbiters when weather permitted. KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for the U.S. government's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Its Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the fourth-largest structure in the world by volume, and was the largest when completed in 1965.

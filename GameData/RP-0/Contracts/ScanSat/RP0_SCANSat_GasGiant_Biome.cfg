	description = Create a satellite that can provide biome mapping of @/targetBodyValid1. For best results, the orbit should have a high inclination to cover all surface area of the planetary body. Be sure to look at the information available for each scanner to determine the best altitude to scan.
	
	genericDescription = Perform a Biome survey of the targeted celestial body.

	synopsis = Perform a Biome survey of @/targetBodyValid1.

	completedMessage = Mission Success! This mapping survey will be very valuable to the scientists on Earth looking to learn more about the surface of the planet. It will allow us to make targeted landings in the future as well.

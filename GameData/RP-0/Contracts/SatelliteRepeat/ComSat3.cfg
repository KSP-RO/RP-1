	description = We have a customer requesting a new Communications Satellite. Design a satellite within their specs and launch into an orbit with the proper orbital parameters as outlined in the contract.&br;&br;This contract can be completed as many times as you would like. The orbits will be chosen randomly from Tundra, Geostationary, Molniya and Geosynchronous orbits.&br;&br;<b><color=red>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color></b>&br;&br;<b>Number of Contracts Completed: $RepeatComSats_Count</b>
	genericDescription = Put a satellite into the requested orbit.

	synopsis = Launch a new Commercial Communications Satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The customer has reported the satellite is in the proper orbit.

//	Part originally created by CobaltWolf as the Pioneer 10 Helium Vector Magnetometer
//	This is the "wrong" part, as BDB has a Mariner 4 Magnetometer. However, the Mariner 4 Magnetometer
//	does not fold, making it difficult to use. The Pioneer 10 magnetometer is very similar, but folds.

	description =  Mounted at the end of this folding boom is the main part of a Helium Vector Magnetometer, used to measure magnetic fields. Though these fields stretch out into space, their study can hint at a planet's core. Experiments like these are also used to study the Sun's magnetic field and how it interacts with planets. Historically, this experiment is based on the ones flown on many missions, including Mariner 4.

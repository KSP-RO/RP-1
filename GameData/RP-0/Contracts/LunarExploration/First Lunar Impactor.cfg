{
	name = first_MoonImpact
	title = First Lunar Impactor
	group = LunarExploration

	description = Design and successfully launch a probe that impacts the surface of the Moon. Scientists at home will record their observations as a result of the impact. Due to the nature of the experiment, the impactor must have significant mass to it. The contract requires the impactor to have at least a 40 kg mass. If you fail to impact the surface, at least flyby of the Moon with a closest approach of no more than 10,000 km, and successfully transmit or return some scientific data from the Moon's vicinity for partial reward. 
	genericDescription = Impact the surface of the Moon with a probe.

	synopsis = Impact the surface of the Moon with a probe

	completedMessage = Congratulations on hitting the Moon! We're getting some great data here.

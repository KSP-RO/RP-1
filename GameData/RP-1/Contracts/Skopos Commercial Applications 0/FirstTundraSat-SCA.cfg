	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>A Tundra orbit is a highly elliptical geosynchronous orbit (note: not geostationary orbit) similar to a Molniya orbit, with a high inclination (usually near 63.4) and an orbital period of one sidereal day. A satellite placed in this orbit spends most of its time over a chosen area of the Earth, a phenomenon known as apogee dwell, allowing it to maintain a line of sight with satellite earth stations at a high latitude for about 8 hours a day. The ground track of a satellite in a tundra orbit is a closed figure eight.<br><br>See the RP-1 wiki for more information on how to get to a Tundra orbit.<br><br>Historical example: Sirius FM-1 (3,800kg, Proton-K)
	synopsis = Launch a test satellite into a Tundra Orbit

	completedMessage = Success! The Tundra orbit is highly eccentric and lets the satellite spend most of its time over a point in the high latitudes.

	description = Our communications around the globe are limited to line of sight because of the curvature of Earth. If we can launch a communications satellite into orbit, we can use it to transmit information to the opposite side of the world. Be sure to include solar panels to generate power.

	synopsis = Launch the first communication satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Satellite communications will be how humans communicate across the globe with each other.

        #rp1_leaders_brill = Yvonne Brill
        #rp1_leaders_brill_desc = Yvonne Madelaine Brill was a Canadian-American rocket and jet propulsion engineer. She is responsible for inventing the fuel-efficient rocket thruster that keeps satellites in orbit today.

Chelomey was also instrumental in working on the Almaz Space Stations which became the basis of the Salyut, Mir, and Zvezda space stations.

        #rp1_leaders_cleaver = Arthur Valentine Cleaver
        #rp1_leaders_cleaver_desc = Arthur "Val Cleaver" was a British aerospace engineer working for de Havilland in the early 1950s, responsible for overseeing the development of the early British rocket plane engines, "Spectre" and "Sprite". He later worked to develop upgraded variants of the Spectre engine that went on to power the prototypes of Blue Steel missiles. In 1956 he took a job with Rolls-Royce as their Chief Rocket Propulsion Engineer. Under his guidance the development of the RZ.2 and RZ.20 took place, built to power the Blue Streak missile.

        #rp1_leaders_glushko = Valentin Glushko
        #rp1_leaders_glushko_desc = Valentin Petrovich Glushko was a Soviet engineer of Ukrainian ethnicity and the designer of rocket engines in the Soviet space program during the heights of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. He is known for designing some of the best engines the world has ever seen, including the RD-107/108, the most powerful rocket engine ever built, the RD-170, and the RD-253 used on the Proton Rocket.

The bureau designed 170 projects of which 94 were made in series. In total, 45,000 MiG aircraft have been manufactured domestically, of which 11,000 aircraft were exported. The last plane which Gurevich personally worked on before his retirement was the MiG-25, which first flew in 1964.

        #rp1_leaders_hickam = Homer Hickam
        #rp1_leaders_hickam_desc = Homer Hadley Hickam Jr. is an American author, Vietnam War veteran, and a former NASA engineer who trained the first Japanese astronauts.

Mr. Hickam is currently the board chair of the U. S. Space & Rocket Center (Space Camp) in Huntsville, Alabama.

        #rp1_leaders_johnson = Katherine Johnson
        #rp1_leaders_johnson_desc = Katherine Johnson was an American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights. During her 33-year career at NASA and its predecessor, she earned a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks.

        #rp1_leaders_korolev = Sergei Korolev
        #rp1_leaders_korolev_desc = Sergei Korolev worked in Soviet rocketry from 1945 until his death in 1966. He was the USSR's lead rocket engineer throughout the space race, designing everything from the Sputnik missions to Gagarin's flight and the Luna probes. He also began work on the massive N1 Moon rocket, though he died before testing began. He was criticised for letting his rivalry with Vladamir Chelomey get in the way of his work and his design approach was blamed for the failure of the N1. Still, it was well-deserved when he was twice honored as Hero of Socialist Labour, the highest award for cultural and industrial accomplishments in the Soviet Union. Considering they sent him to the Gulag in 1938 on false charges, this was the least they could do.

        #rp1_leaders_kraft = Chris Kraft
        #rp1_leaders_kraft_desc = Christopher Columbus Kraft Jr. was an American aerospace and NASA engineer who was instrumental in establishing the agency's Mission Control Center and shaping its organization and culture.

He characteristically wore a close-cut flattop hairstyle and the dapper "mission" vests (waistcoats) of different styles and materials made by his wife, Marta Kranz, for his Flight Director missions.\n\nHe coined the phrase "tough and competent", which became known as the "Kranz Dictum". Kranz has been the subject of movies, documentary films, and books and periodical articles. Kranz is a recipient of a Presidential Medal of Freedom. In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Kranz was ranked as the #2 most popular space hero.

        #rp1_leaders_kármán = Theodore von Kármán
        #rp1_leaders_kármán_desc = Theodore von Kármán was a Hungarian-American mathematician, aerospace engineer, and physicist who was active primarily in the fields of aeronautics and astronautics. He was responsible for many key advances in aerodynamics, notably on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization. He is regarded as an outstanding aerodynamic theoretician of the 20th century. When looking into high-altitude flight, he calculated that the speed required to produce enough lift for a airplane to stay aloft would be the same as orbital speed at 82 kilometers altitude. This was then rounded to 100 kilometers and is why the Karman line is considered the boundary of space.

        #rp1_leaders_love = Betty Love
        #rp1_leaders_love_desc = Betty Love was an engineer and computer that worked for NACA at the High Speed Research Station at Muroc Air Force Base.

        #rp1_leaders_morgan = Mary Sherman Morgan
        #rp1_leaders_morgan_desc = Mary Sherman Morgan was a U.S. chemist and rocket fuel scientist who developed explosives during WWII, and then worked on hypergolic propellants during the Space Race. She invented the liquid fuel Hydyne in 1957, a 60/40 mix of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and diethylenetriamine that offered a significant performance advantage over ethanol. Because it would be pared with liquid oxygen, she thought Bagel would be a fun name, which would lead to engines being described as using Bagel-LOX. Unfortunately, the U.S. Army rejected this whimsical name. Hydyne powered the Jupiter-C rocket that launched the United States' first satellite, Explorer 1.

        #rp1_leaders_narayanan = Nambi Narayanan
        #rp1_leaders_narayanan_desc = Nambi Narayanan is an Indian aerospace engineer who was responsible for leading the team that acquired the technology for the Viking engine from the French and indigenizing it into the Vikas engine, which is used extensively by ISRO to this day.

        #rp1_leaders_aerojet = Aerojet
        #rp1_leaders_aerojet_desc = Aerojet was a rocket and missile propulsion company. They developed the AJ-10, one of the longest lasting engine families out there, the Aerobee and Titan rockets, and competed with Rocketdyne to provide engines for the Saturn V, though Rocketdyne won for all of the lower stages. Aerojet developed from a 1936 meeting with Theodore von Kármán and a number of Caltech professors and students, including Fritz Zwicky and Jack Parsons, all of whom were interested in the topic of spaceflight. Their first design was tested on August 16, 1941, consisting of a small solid-fuel motor attached to the bottom of a plane. Takeoff distance was shortened by half, and the USAAF placed an order for experimental production versions. They saw a lot of success in the early days of spaceflight, but, like many U.S. rocket companies, they downsized during during the late 80s and early 90s. They started to grow again in the early 2000s and bought Rocketdyne in 2012.

        #rp1_leaders_bell = Bell Aircraft Company
        #rp1_leaders_bell_desc = Bell developed the X-1, the first supersonic aircraft, as well as a variety of fighter aircraft and helicopters. They also contributed to the RCS systems for Mercury and the X-15. They built the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (aka Flying Bedstead), the ascent engine for the Apollo LM, and were responsible for the rather harebrained idea of a lunar escape vehicle controlled by leaning.

        #rp1_leaders_douglas = Douglas Aircraft Company
        #rp1_leaders_douglas_desc = Douglas started out in 1921 as an aircraft manufacturer, but after WW2, they started producing missiles and sounding rockets. Their aircraft were mostly civilian or military transport, so they won't help you build X-planes. All of the aircraft starting with DC- were built by them, including the quite successful DC-8. In spaceflight, they built the Thor rocket and the S-IVB stage, which was the second stage of the Saturn IB and third stage of the Saturn V.

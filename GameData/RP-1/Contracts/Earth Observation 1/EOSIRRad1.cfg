	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Weather forecasting today would be impossible without the numerous weather satellites constantly observing our atmosphere from orbit.  Launch the very first dedicated weather satellite to measure temperatures in the atmosphere and correlate those with real-time video.&br;&br;<b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains an Infrared Radiometer 1 experiment and an Early TV camera.</color></b>&br;&br;Real life examples: TIROS-1.

	synopsis = Launch the first weather satellite with the Infrared Radiometry experiment and an Early TV camera.

	completedMessage = Success! The images provided from this satellite have proven that weather satellites can be extremely effective in helping meteorologists predict the weather.

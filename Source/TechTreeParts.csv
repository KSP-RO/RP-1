liquidEngine,LR105 Series,275,5500,"Kerolox gas-generator sustainer engine used in the Atlas launch vehicle. It, like the Atlas's booster engines (LR89s) are lit on the ground, but after a bit over 2 minutes' flight the boosters are dropped and the Atlas core continues to orbit under the power of the sustainer engine (and the verniers for roll control and final adjustment). The final configuration of the LR105 (like the LR89) uses RS-27 components for increased performance. As a sustainer engine, the LR105 has relatively poor sea level specific impulse compared to most boosters, but somewhat better vacuum specific impulse--though the difference in both is nowhere near as pronounced as when comparing a booster to an upper stage engine.

The XLR81 family was derived from the Bell Hustler Rocket Engine, which was developed for use on an air-to-surface missile. Early engines were nearly identical to the Hustler engine, while later variants offered new capabilities and improved performance. Engine restart was introduced on the Agena B's XLR81-BA-7 (Model 8081). The XLR81-BA-11 (Model 8096) used on Agena D used propellant sumps to eliminate the need for ullage thrust. The XLR81-BA-13 (Model 8247) powered the Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (a modified Agena D) and was rated for up to 14 restarts. Diameter: [0.9 m].

The XLR81 family was derived from the Bell Hustler Rocket Engine, which was developed for use on an air-to-surface missile. Early engines were nearly identical to the Hustler engine, while later variants offered new capabilities and improved performance. Engine restart was introduced on the Agena B's XLR81-BA-7 (Model 8081). The XLR81-BA-11 (Model 8096) used on Agena D used propellant sumps to eliminate the need for ullage thrust. The XLR81-BA-13 (Model 8247) powered the Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (a modified Agena D) and was rated for up to 14 restarts. Diameter: [0.9 m]. Using the patented SSTU Engine-Clustering technology the number of engines, engine layout, mounting or shroud type, and mount/shroud size are configurable, and each set of engines are built to your specifications.

	description = As communications between countries continue to grow, so does the need for increasingly complex satellite systems. We have proven the utility of geostationary orbits for communications. Now it is time to exploit that potiential by placing series of increasingly advanced communications satellites in orbit. The payload required on the satellite will increase with each series.<br><b>The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload to operational control after being placed sucessfully in orbit.</b><br>This series contains @length contracts, of which @seriesIndex have been completed.<br>Real life examples: Intelsat 2, 3, 4, 4A, 5, 6, 7, 9 series

	description = Design and successfully launch an uncrewed probe to land on an Asteroid, gather science, and bring the science back to Earth. This is a sample return missions so you cannot just transmit the data back, it needs to be physically returned.\n\nDon't forget that in order to "land" on an Asteroid in KSP terms, you need to have a grappling hook and attach yourself to one.

	synopsis = Send an uncrewed craft to land on an Asteroid and return the science to Earth.

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Our scientists can learn a lot more about the make-up of the asteroids by studying the physical samples that you have returned.

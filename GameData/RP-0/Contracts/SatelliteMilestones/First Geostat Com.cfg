	description = A geostationary orbit is a circular equatorial orbit around Earth of a satellite with an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period of 23h 56m 4.1s. An object in geostationary orbit remains in exactly the same position in the sky. Communications satellites are often given geostationary or close to geostationary orbits so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move, but can be pointed permanently at the fixed location in the sky where the satellite appears. Launch a communications satellite into geostationary orbit.
	synopsis = Launch the first geostationary communication satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The geostationary orbit is the most commonly used orbit for communications satellites and other observation satellites.

	description = Congratulations on starting a new space program! For your first mission, you should launch your first vessel. Just design and build a vessel, roll it out to the pad (or runway if an airplane), and stage to take off! (And note all the records to break in the 'Active Contracts' tab. They update, so keep checking.)
	
	synopsis = Launch a rocket or aircraft
	
	completedMessage = Congratulations! Your space program is off to a great start. Now it is time for some "rocket science" as you need to continue to go higher, faster, and farther.

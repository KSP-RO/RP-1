	description = Design, build and launch a rocket that will travel 4500km or more over ground while carrying @/missionPayload.Print() units of Sounding Payload. This challenge will require rather more delta V than the 3000km attempt. <b><color="white">Your rocket must be suborbital (over 140 km) for the contract to be completed. Additionally the first 50 seconds of the flight must be done under active guidance (using Near-Earth avionics).</color></b> Perfecting this is part of Launch Vehicle development to utilize a gravity turn and tune your ascent profile and angle of attack. The current distance that your rocket has traveled can be seen in the contract parameters in the Contracts App display for this contract. It will update in real time. &br;&br;<b><color="green">NOTE: The distance that you see provided by KSP in the F3 screen is not accurate, so please do not base your attempts off of it.</color></b>
	
	synopsis = Travel 4500km or more downrange with an uncrewed craft carrying @/missionPayload.Print() units of Sounding Payload.

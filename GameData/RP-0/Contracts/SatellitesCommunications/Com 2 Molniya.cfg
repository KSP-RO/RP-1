	title = Molniya Communications Satellite
	description = While highly inclined orbits give us better coverage over the high latitudes, we can do better. A Molniya orbit is a type of highly elliptical orbit with an inclination of 63.4 degrees, an argument of perigee of −90 degrees and a semi-synchronous orbital period of exactly one half of a sidereal day. A satellite in a Molniya orbit lingers over the northern latitudes for the majority of its orbit and then whips across the southern hemisphere rapidly, giving the orbit its namesake ("Molniya" roughly translates to "lightning", a reference to the speed with which these satellites transit the southern part of their orbit). Because the orbit is semi-synchronous, it will follow the same ground track with every two orbits.<br><b>There will be an orbit showing in the map view and tracking station. You do not have to place the satellite into this orbit, but it is instead meant to show you where your Perigee and Apogee should approximately be located, but more importantly, it shows the proper shape of the orbit.</b><br><b>The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload to operational control after being placed sucessfully in orbit.</b><br>This contract may be repeated infinitely. Currently @index have been completed.<br>Real life examples: Molniya-1, -2, -3 and varients

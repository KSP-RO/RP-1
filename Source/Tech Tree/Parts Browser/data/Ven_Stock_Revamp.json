        "description": "The Castor 4 was developed as the second stage of the Athena H missile and first flew in 1971. It was later adapted to replace Delta's Castor 2 boosters, increasing GTO capacity from 1593 lb (723 kg) to nearly 2000 lb (900 kg). The resulting Delta 3000-series launched in 1975 and was the first to adopt a staggered booster staging sequence. Previous Delta vehicles burned their motors in a 6-3 sequence and then jettisoned all SRMs at once. The heavier and longer-burning Castor 4 required that the ground-lit motors be jettisoned immediately after depletion to reduce dead weight. Early launches used a less efficient 5-4 sequence to reduce acceleration but returned to a 6-3 sequence after Delta was strengthened in the early 80s. Diameter: [1.02 m].

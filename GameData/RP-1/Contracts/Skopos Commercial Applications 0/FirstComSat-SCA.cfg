	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Communications around the globe are limited to line of sight because of the curvature of Earth. If we can launch a communications satellite into orbit, we can use it to transmit information to the opposite side of the world. Launching a satellite into an eccentric low earth orbit is a good place to start. It should be relatively easy with existing launch vehicles, and the high apogee will provide good lines of sight for a few minutes every orbit. However, providing global communications coverage with such a low orbit would require very many satellites.<br><br>Historical example: Telstar 1 (78kg, Thor-Delta).

	synopsis = Launch the first low orbit communication satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Satellite communications will forever change communications around the globe.

	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = It would be great for all humans if we could find a way to better predict the weather. One of the first steps in this is to understand the properties of the upper atmosphere. Insert a satellite with a Barometer and Thermometer on it to measure the values found. Transmit the science back to the KSC for analysis.&br;&br;This could be considered the first "Weather Satellite" and will open up new weather satellite opportunities.

	synopsis = Launch a Satellite to study the upper atmosphere

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The information returned from the satellite has allowed our scientists to make some more accurate predictions of the weather. Our next step is to get a camera into orbit.

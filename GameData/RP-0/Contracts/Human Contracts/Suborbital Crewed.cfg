	description = Crewed suborbital flights are used as a safer prelude to an orbital mission, for research, or to set non-orbital altitude records. Send any number of crew above @VesselGroup/ReachAlt/minAltitude meters to satisfy the requirements of this mission. Historical missions used the Mercury capsule (1961, Mercury-Redstone), the X-15 (1963, B-52), and SpaceShipOne (2004, White Knight).<b><color=white>NOTE: You can not select this contract and 'First Orbital Flight (Crewed') or 'X-Planes High' at the same time. If you select the other contract while this is active, this will automatically fail.</color></b>&br;&br;<b>Number of Contracts Completed: $CrewedSuborbital_Count</b>
	
	genericDescription = Launch a crewed spacecraft or spaceplane with at least one person aboard into a suborbital trajectory of at least the given apogee and return safely home.

	synopsis = Send a crewed vessel on a suborbital flight

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The crew has returned safely and we put another person in space.

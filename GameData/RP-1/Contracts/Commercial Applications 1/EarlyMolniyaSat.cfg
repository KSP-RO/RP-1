	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Now that satellite communications technology has been proven, launch more capable satellites to expand communication coverage further around Earth. Some customers want satellites that dwell longer over the higher latitudes using Molniya orbits. Launch a new communications satellite with the required specifications with the unique Molniya orbital parameters.<br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color><br><br><b>The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.&br;<b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @RP0:expectedDays_EarlyComSat<br>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / unlimited</b>
	genericDescription = Put a satellite with the required amount of communications satellite payload into the desired orbit.

	synopsis = Launch a customer communication satellite into a Molniya orbit.

	completedMessage = Success! The communications satellite was launched into the proper orbit. Your customer is very happy.

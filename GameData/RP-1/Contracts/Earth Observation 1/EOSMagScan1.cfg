	description = <b>Program: Early Earth Observation Satellites<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Anyone that has ever used a compass is familiar with the magnetic fields that encapsulate Earth.  Launch a satellite to better charaterize the strength and direction of the magnetic field, and determine how far into space its influence is felt.<br><br><b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains a Magnetic Scan experiment.  Launch it into an elliptical orbit and return 75% worth of science from both Low and High Earth Orbit.</color></b><br><br>Historical example: IMP-A (138kg, Thor-Delta)

	synopsis = Launch the first dedicated magnetometry satellite.

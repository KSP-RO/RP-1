	description = The MIMS was an improvement on the Bennett radio version. These had miniaturized magnetic sector field instruments and the mass resolution was much higher than the Bennett RF spectrometer. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. This data can show not just the composition of the ionosphere, but also how the solar wind affects it, and can detect the interchange between layers of the atmosphere. Historically, these experiments were flown on Explorer 31, AE-C, and other Earth Satellites.

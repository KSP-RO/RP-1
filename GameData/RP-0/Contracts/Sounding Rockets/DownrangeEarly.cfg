	description = The challenge of orbit is not merely to go high, which has been shown by breaching the Karman line, but to achieve great horizontal speed. Design, build and launch a rocket that will travel 3000km or more over ground. Such a rocket is typically two stages (guided lower stage coupled with an unguided upper stage), has 6 km/s or more of delta V, and is using upgraded engines, tanks, and/or avionics. Do this, and you will be halfway to orbit! <b><color="white">Your rocket must be suborbital (over 140 km) for the contract to be completed. Additionally the first 50 seconds of the flight must be done under active guidance (using Near-Earth avionics).</color></b> Perfecting this is part of Launch Vehicle development to utilize a gravity turn and tune your ascent profile and angle of attack. The current distance that your rocket has traveled can be seen in the contract parameters in the Contracts App display for this contract. It will update in real time. &br;&br;<b><color="green">NOTE: The distance that you see provided by KSP in the F3 screen is not accurate, so please do not base your attempts off of it.</color></b>

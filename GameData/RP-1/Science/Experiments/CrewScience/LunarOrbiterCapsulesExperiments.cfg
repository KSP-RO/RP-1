// The Apollo B&W slow scan television system used 500 kHz of bandwith. This corresponds with a 500 kbps (62.5 kB/s) data rate according to the Shannon Hartley theorem, which states a most efficient transfer limit of about 1 bit per Hz of spectrum.
// However, it has been decided more antenna bands are bad, so 150 kbps (18.75 kB/s) it is.

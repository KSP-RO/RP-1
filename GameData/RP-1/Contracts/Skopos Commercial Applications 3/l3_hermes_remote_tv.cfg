  title = Experimental Ku-band Remote Television
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>The C-band frequencies are heavily utilized for both satellite and terrestrial communications. There are growing concerns that there will not be enough bandwidth to accommodate future growth in telecommunications demand. Additionally, C-band satellite earth stations require large and expensive antennas to recieve signals from satellites in orbit. However, recent advances in technology have allowed for the creation of lightweight and efficient millimeter-wave transcievers, operating in what is now known as Ku-band.<br>Ku-band offers much wider frequency allocations than C-band, and allows for the use of much smaller antennas. This has allowed for the creation of a portable satellite earth station that is able to fit on a single truck. We would like to test the capabilities of this portable station to recieve and transmit TV from remote communities in the Canada.<br><br>Historical example: CTS "Hermes" (680kg, Delta 2914).

  notes = A new satellite earth station has been constructed in Allan Park, and a portable Ku-band station has been positioned in Yellowknife (Northwest Territories). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support a link to a low power portable Ku-band satellite earth station.

  synopsis = Provide remote two-way telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).

  completedMessage = The functionality of our portable Ku-band satellite earth station has been confirmed. This will allow for telecommunications to remote communities and rapid response emergency command centers for isolated areas.

	description = Just putting an object in orbit is a stunt. Getting valuable scientific data from it is far more impressive.&br;&br;With the data returned from our sounding rockets, interesting radiation has been observed. We need you to send a scientific satellite to study this data with more accuracy. Based on the best guesses of our scientists, having an eccentric orbit will be most useful for learning more about the radiation surrounding Earth.<br><b>Make sure your craft can survive in space for several days and contains a Geiger-Muller counter or scintillation counter, as we will need science returned.</b><br>Real life examples: Object D (Sputnik 3), Explorer 1.
		
	synopsis = Launch a scientific satellite into an eccentric orbit of Earth with cosmic ray science experiments
		
	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite you sent into orbit has returned extremely valuable data that has proven the existence of the Van Allen Radiation Belts.

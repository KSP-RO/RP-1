// 	I would like to expand this out to be used as Biological Samples like now and also preparation for crewed flight. Essentially make boiler plates of the Mercury, Vostok, Mk.1, Gemini, Apollo, Soyuz capsules and have them filled with "Biological Sensors". There were 4 (or 5) flights that the Soviets flew (Korabl-Sputnik) as well as all of the US flights as well. I figure this might be a good reason for players to do the same.

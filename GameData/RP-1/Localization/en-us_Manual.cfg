        #rp1_agencies_fai = Federation Aeronautique Internationale
        #rp1_agencies_fai_desc = Founded in 1905, the FAI is the governing body for air sports and for aeronautics and astronautics world records. If you're setting a milestone, odds are the FAI is the group certifying it. Funding, however, will come from your government--the FAI doesn't offer prizes, just record records.
        
        #rp1_agencies_gps = GPS
        #rp1_agencies_gps_desc = The Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar GPS, is a space-based radionavigation system owned by the United States government and operated by the United States Air Force. It is a global navigation satellite system that provides geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.
        
        #rp1_agencies_glonass = GLONASS
        #rp1_agencies_glonass_desc = GLONASS, or "Global Navigation Satellite System", is a space-based satellite navigation system operating in the radionavigation-satellite service. It provides an alternative to GPS and is the second navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision.

        #rp1_crafts_jettrainer = Jet Trainer
        #rp1_crafts_jettrainer_desc = Basic subsonic jet aircraft. 2 seater, very forgiving flight characteristics, if a bit twitchy at low speeds. Rotate at 35 m/s, liftoff at 45 m/s. Stall speed 40 m/s, max speed 270 m/s. AG 1 extends flaps, AG2 retracts them.
        
        #rp1_crafts_ssjettrainner = Supersonic Jet Trainer
        #rp1_crafts_ssjettrainner_desc = Supersonic jet trainer based on a classic fighter jet. AG 1 to lower flaps, AG 2 to raise flaps. Rotate at 70 m/s, liftoff speed 90 m/s, landing speed 80 m/s, Max Speed Mach 1.6, G limit 8 Gs. Watch out for tailstrikes!

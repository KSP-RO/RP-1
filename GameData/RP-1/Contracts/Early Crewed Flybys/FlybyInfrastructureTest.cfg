	description = <b>Program: Crewed Early Interplanetary Flybys<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Before sending crew to interplanetary space, putting them into a high orbit above the Earths radiation belts can simulate environmental conditions that will be similar during the interplanetary flights. This mission can also test mission architecture and hardware while being close enough for a return to Earth in a few hours in the event of an emergency. Such a spacecraft must remain in orbit with its crew for 14 days and return them safely to Earth.

	synopsis = Fly a two-plus-person HEO mission for 14 days.

	completedMessage = Crew alive and well after the mission! We now have supporting data for the upcoming flyby missions.

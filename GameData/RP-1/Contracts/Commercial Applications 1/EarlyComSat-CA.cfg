	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications</b><br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Now that satellite communications technology has been proven, launch more capable satellites to expand communication coverage further around Earth.  Every major Telecom now wants their own satellite capabilities tailored to their specific needs. Launch new communications satellites with the required specifications into the specified orbits.<br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color><br><br>The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.<br><b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @RP0:expectedDays_EarlyComSat<br>Number of Contracts Completed: @index / unlimited</b>
	genericDescription = Put a satellite with the required amount of communications satellite payload into the desired orbit.

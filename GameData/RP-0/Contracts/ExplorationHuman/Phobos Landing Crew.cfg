	description = Some of our scientists and engineers believe that we should land humans on Phobos before trying to take on a landing of Mars. They expect landing on Phobos will be similar to how we landed on our own Moon.&br;&br;Design a mission that will successfully land at least two humans on Phovos and return safely to Earth.&br;&br;Remember that the typical Mars launch window is about 2 years, so plan your launches accordingly.

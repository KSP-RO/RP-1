	//Mercury

	//Venus
	//Mountains
	VenusSrfLandedMountains = The ground here seems to be covered in a 'frost' of dense metal.

	//Canyons
	VenusSrfLandedCanyons = The rock here has been ripped apart by tectonic forces. 

	//Lakshmi Planum
	VenusSrfLandedLakshmiPlanum = The rock appears to be solidified lava. You wonder how immense the eruption must have been that created it.

	//Fortuna Tessera
	VenusSrfLandedFortunaTessera = You reach down into one of the cracks and take a soil sample. The rock contains extremely high amounts of volcanic material. 

	//Volcanic Rise
	VenusSrfLandedVolcanicRise = The ground here is cracked and splintered. There seems to be a high amount of volcanic material. 

	//Highlands

	//Midlands

	//Lowlands




	//Earth



	//Moon
	//general
	MoonSrfLanded = The ground materials appear to be a combination of basaltic rocks and breccia.

	//Lowlands

	//Highlands
	MoonSrfLandedHighlands = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials that have layered over time.
	MoonSrfLandedHighlands = The sample appears to be comprised of a large number of materials that have layered over time.
	MoonSrfLandedHighlands = The sample has low amounts of basaltic rock. This might account for the changes in coloration we've seen.
	
	//Midlands
	MoonSrfLandedMidlands = The darker midlands surface appears to be made up of basaltic rocks.

	//Lunar Seas

	//Major Craters
	MoonSrfLandedMajorCraters = The sample contains a combination of breccia and melted materials.
	MoonSrfLandedMajorCraters = The sample contains a combination of breccia and melted materials.
	MoonSrfLandedMajorCraters = There are high concentrations of metals in this crater.
	MoonSrfLandedMajorCraters = This crater must have had a really nasty impact, the samples are heavier than normal.
	MoonSrfLandedMajorCraters = The crater seems to contain materials from lower layers of the surface.
	MoonSrfLandedMajorCraters = Samples from this location seem to show intense shock patterns.

	//Far Side Basin
	MoonSrfLandedFarSideBasin = The surface here consists of multiple types of rock. Some appear almost crystalline.

	//North Pole
	MoonSrfLandedNorthPole = You examine the rocks you have collected. Upon further investigation, you realise that there is a strange weight to one of them, it does not feel like it has the same weight as the other rocks you've collected and seems hollow. You promptly place it into a sample container.
	MoonSrfLandedNorthPole = The samples here show lower concentrations of ejecta. There appears to be some liquids in the soil that have frozen permanently.
	MoonSrfLandedNorthPole = It's a cold piece of soil. As cold as ice. Wait.

	//South Pole
	MoonSrfLandedSouthPole = You examine the rocks you have collected. Upon further investigation, you realise that there is a strange weight to one of them, it does not feel like it has the same weight as the other rocks you've collected and seems hollow. You promptly place it into a sample container.
	MoonSrfLandedSouthPole = The samples here show lower concentrations of ejecta. There appears to be some liquids in the soil that have frozen permanently.
	MoonSrfLandedSouthPole = It's a cold piece of soil. As cold as ice. Wait.



	//Mars
	//North Pole
	MarsSrfLandedNorthPole = Breaking through the thin crust, you find layers of dirt mixed with ice, laid down in countless cycles of thawing and freezing.
	
	//South Pole
	MarsSrfLandedSouthPole = Breaking through the thin crust, you find layers of dirt mixed with ice, laid down in countless cycles of thawing and freezing.

	//Lowlands 
	MarsSrfLandedLowlands = The small rock you pick up seems to be of sedimentary origin. You wonder if there was ever a lake here.
	MarsSrfLandedLowlands = The soil contains significant quantities of sodium, potassium, chlorine, and magnesium. Almost prime crop soil, if it weren't for the dessication, lack of atmospheric pressure, and being on Mars.

	//Valles Marineris
	MarsSrfLandedVallesMarineris = The rocks here appear to contain many water minerals. Did water once flow through this canyon?

	//Midlands
	MarsSrfLandedMidlands = The soil contains significant quantities of sodium, potassium, chlorine, and magnesium. Almost prime crop soil, if it weren't for the dessication, lack of atmospheric pressure, and being on Mars.

	//Higlands
	MarsSrfLandedHighlands = The soil contains significant quantities of sodium, potassium, chlorine, and magnesium. Almost prime crop soil, if it weren't for the dessication, lack of atmospheric pressure, and being on Mars.



	//Phobos
	//Craters
	PhobosSrfLandedCraters = The craters contain small meteorite fragments. Somehow they fell back down despite the low gravity.

	//Io

	//Europa

	//Ganymede

	//Callisto

	//Titan
	//Water
	TitanSrfSplashedWater = The lake appears to be made of liquefied natural gas.

	description = The geiger counter measures ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays using the ionization effect created inside the tube. By measuring radiation as a spacecraft orbits, it's possible to detect things like Van Allen belts, and an instrument like this is what first discovered Earth's Van Allen belts.

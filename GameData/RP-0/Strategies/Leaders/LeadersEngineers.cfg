	desc = Sergei Korolev worked in Soviet rocketry from 1945 until his death in 1966. He was the USSR's lead rocket engineer throughout the space race, designing everything from the Sputnik missions to Gagarin's flight and the Luna probes. He also began work on the massive N1 Moon rocket, though he died before testing began. He was criticised for letting his rivalry with Vladamir Chelomey get in the way of his work and his design approach was blamed for the failure of the N1. Still, it was well-deserved when he was twice honored as Hero of Socialist Labour, the highest award for cultural and industrial accomplishments in the Soviet Union. Considering they sent him to the Gulag in 1938 on false charges, this was the least they could do.

His major fault was not believing that hydrolox was a suitable propellant for a space engine.

She invented the liquid fuel Hydyne in 1957, a 60/40 mix of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and diethylenetriamine that offered a significant performance advantage over ethanol. Because it would be pared with liquid oxygen, she though Bagel would be a fun name, which would lead to engines being described as using Bagel-LOX. Unfortunately, the U.S. Army rejected this whimsical name. Hydyne powered the Jupiter-C rocket that launched the United States' first satellite, Explorer 1.

He later worked to develop upgraded variants of the "Spectre" engine, that went on to power the Blue Steel missile.  In 1956, Val Cleaver handed in his notice to de Havilland, and took a job with Rolls-Royce as their Chief Rocket Propulsion Engineer. Under his guidance the development of the RZ.2 and RZ.20 took place, built to power the Blue Streak missile. Both were considered highly advanced engines at the time, they later went on to power the first stage of Europa 1. Arthur Val Cleaver was awarded an Order of the British Empire, a prestigious medal for prominent national achievements.

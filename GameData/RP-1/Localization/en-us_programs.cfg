        #rp1_programs_targetedsats_obj = Launch satellites to analyze weather and assist in navigation and reach a variety of specific orbits, including geostationary.

        #rp1_programs_commnetwork = Communication Network
        #rp1_programs_commnetwork_desc = Communicating with our satellites, and eventually our crewed craft, can be difficult at times. Unless we have line of sight to a tracking station, communication isn't possible.

        #rp1_programs_uncrewedlunarsurface_desc = Landing uncrewed probes on the Moon is the next step in exploring the Solar System. Successfully landing on the Moon is a difficult problem to solve. You will need to develop even more capable launch vehicles to be able to launch a large enough payload. These uncrewed landings will give you the data you need to plan for your crewed landings to follow. You will need to research deeply-throttleable engines from the Early Landing node (recommended) or figure out how to perform a landing with RCS.
        #rp1_programs_uncrewedlunarsurface_req = Complete the Early Lunar Probes program
        #rp1_programs_uncrewedlunarsurface_obj = Land probes on the Moon.

Alternatively, this could be an opportunity for some command chair antics. But a proper rocket is probably your best bet. You will need to upgrade your astronaut complex to level three to plant a flag on the Moon and complete the first crewed landing contract.
        #rp1_programs_crewedlunar_req = Complete contracts X and Y
        #rp1_programs_crewedlunar_obj = Send crew to flyby, orbit, and land on the Moon.

        #rp1_programs_marssurfaceexp_obj = Complete the program by sending a rover to Mars.

        #rp1_programs_venussurfaceexp = Venus Surface Exploration
        #rp1_programs_venussurfaceexp_desc = Send probes to Venus to see what the surface and atmosphere are really like. The dense clouds hide the surface from view, while the corrosive atmosphere and high heat present challenges for anything trying to descend to the surface. Keeping a probe operational for any length of time presents significant challenges. Even with heat-resistant materials, nothing seems able to survive for more than a few hours.

        #rp1_programs_mercuryexploration_desc = Mercury is the least explored of the inner planets, due to the difficulty of orbiting it. Send some probes there to find out more about it. Current data suggests that Mercury is tidally locked with the Sun. How will this affect its surface? Or did we just flyby it at remarkably synchronized times? Either way, sending probes to orbit and land on Mercury will provide fascinating data on the closest planet to the Sun.

        #rp1_programs_jupiterobservation = Jupiter Observation
        #rp1_programs_jupiterobservation_desc = Jupiter presents many opportunities for exploration, but also many challenges: it requires almost the same amount of energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. Gravity assists can be used to save delta-v at the cost of flight duration. Once there, a rich and diverse system awaits any explorer. Along with the largest planet in the Solar System, the Jovian system is also home to the largest moon, Ganymede, a planetary-mass moon. This program will send uncrewed scientific probes to Jupiter and its moons.<br><br>Historically, Jupiter is the most-visited outer planet, with 9 missions having completed flybys or entered orbits, most notably by the Voyager missions in 1979 on their flybys towards the outer Solar System, and by the Juno orbiter whose mission continues today.

Visible from Earth with little more than a set of binoculars, Saturn's rings have intrigued observers for centuries. Further, with the highest number of moons in the entire Solar System, and more discovered with each additional mission, the Saturn system is a destination with extensive exploration opportunities. Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, may have an atmosphere conducive to life, while Enceladus is thought to contain liquid water below its icy exterior. Explore the Saturn system with uncrewed probes, analyzing the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan, and take a closer look at the larger moons of the system.<br><br>Historical missions to Saturn include flybys from Pioneer 11 and both Voyagers, while the Cassini orbiter mission operated from 2004 to 2017.

While Jupiter and Saturn can be seen with a hobbyist telescope, they cannot be closely studied from Earth. The immense mass of the gas giants means that, while they might not receive much sunlight, tidal forces can keep their many moons warm. There may even be liquid water somewhere out there. Send probes to survey these distant bodies. Gravity assists are highly recommended.
        #rp1_programs_outerplanetflyby_req = Complete contracts X and Y
        #rp1_programs_outerplanetflyby_obj = Flyby at least four of the outer planets.

        #rp1_programs_outergasgiantsurvey = Outer Gas Giant Survey
        #rp1_programs_outergasgiantsurvey_desc = Pictures can help expand our knowledge of the outer Solar System, but scientific instruments and dwell times much longer than a hasty flyby are necessary to increase our understanding of these distant neighbors. Send orbiters to the two furthest gas giants and probe their atmospheres. While in the furthest reaches of our system, explore the moons of these giants as well. An upgraded Tracking Station and higher level comm tech will be necessary in order to receive scientific data over such great distances.

It is now time for you to land on them, quite possibly within a century of their discovery. Very little is known about these distant, icy worlds. Historically, even our most advanced probes have returned relatively little data compared to what we know about our closer neighbors. Explore the furthest reaches of the Solar System and land on this intriguing pair of dwarf planets.

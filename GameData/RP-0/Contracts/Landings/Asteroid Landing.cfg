	group = Landings
	agent = Surveys

	description = Design and successfully launch an uncrewed probe that will soft land on an Asteroid and transmit a science report from the surface. This contract can be completed 2 times.&br;&br;Don't forget that in order to "land" on an Asteroid in KSP terms, you need to have a grappling hook and attach yourself to one.

	synopsis = Send an uncrewed probe to land on an Asteroid

	completedMessage = Congratulations! Landing a probe on Asteroid is not easy! The science gathered from this lander will unlock some of the secrets of our early Solar System.

  title = Soviet Telecommunications - Level 3
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The second generation telecommunications satellite network has proven successful. However, with just a single central television feed, it is difficult to provide timely TV programming across 11 time zones. Further, our existing satellite earth stations are expensive to construct and maintain, and in order to continue spreading TV coverage to remote communities we would like to reduce costs. Provide five dedicated regional connections, and support connections to smaller satellite earth stations.<br><br>Historical example: Gorizont series satellites (2,300kg, Proton-K Blok-DM).

  notes = Additional Earth Stations have been constructed in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (Sakhalinskaya Oblast, USSR), Yakutsk (Yakutskaya Autonomous SSR, USSR), Surgut (Khanty-Mansiyskiy Autonomous Okrug, USSR) and Arkhangel'sk (Arkhangel'sk Oblast, USSR). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 8 links at the same time, plus the previous level 1 and 2 services.

  synopsis = Provide telecommunications service to the Soviet Union with 95% availability (~23 h per day) over a 90 days period.

  completedMessage = Viewers across the Soviet Union can now recieve region-specific news and entertainment broadcasts at regular times, and television coverage continues to be expanded.

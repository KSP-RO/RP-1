	description = <b>Program: Suborbital Research<br>Type: <color=red>CAPSTONE</color></b><br><br>By training and launching a larger mammal in a capsule with recording instruments, we can test how astronauts might perform tasks under similar conditions. For instance, whether they'll be able to focus under the heavy G-loads, vibrations, and noise encountered during the launch into and recovery from orbit. <br>Carry an advanced biological capsule and @payload units of monitoring instrumentation on a suborbital trajectory, then recover the experiment.<br><br><color=white><b>After this contract has been completed, the 'Advanced Biological Suborbital Experiment' contract will become available.</b></color>
	genericDescription = Put an advanced biological capsule and some scientific payload on a suborbital trajectory and recover both safely.
	synopsis = Launch a rocket with an advanced biological capsule and @payload units of Sounding Rocket Payload on a suborbital trajectory and recover them.
	completedMessage = Well done! Our subject survived and our scientists are now examining it and the collected data!

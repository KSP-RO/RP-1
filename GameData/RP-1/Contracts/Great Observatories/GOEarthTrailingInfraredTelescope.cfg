	description = <b>Program: Great Observatories<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>With the success of the Infrared Space Observatory, scientists are eager for a higher-precision follow-up telescope. Launch an infrared space telescope to a cooler Earth-trailing orbit to study exoplanets, space dust, and spectra of various objects.<br><br><b><color="green">Make sure your craft contains an Infrared Space Telescope 2 experiment and arrives at an orbit that slowly moves away from Earth.</color></b><br><br>Historical example: Spitzer Space Telescope.

	synopsis = Launch the first infrared space telescope to solar orbit, and return at least 30 days of science observations.

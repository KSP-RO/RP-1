	description = Design, build and launch a rocket with @/missionPayload.Print() units of Sounding Rocket Payload to a downrange distance of @/missionDistance.Print() km. <b><color="white">Your rocket must be suborbital (over 140 km) for the contract to be completed.</color></b> Perfecting this is part of Launch Vehicle development to utilize a gravity turn and tune your ascent profile and angle of attack. The current distance that your rocket has traveled can be seen in the contract parameters screen. It will update in real time. A better option is to use the MechJeb information called Downrange Distance. It can be added to any window using the Custom Window Editor and is found in the Flight Recorder section.&br;&br;<b><color="green">NOTE: The distance that you see provided by KSP in the F3 screen is not accurate, so please do not base your attempts off of it.</color></b>//&br;&br;<b>DEBUG</b>&br;Difficulty: @/soundingDifficultyLevel&br;Min Payout: @/currentMinPayment&br;Max Payout: @/currentMaxPayment&br;newPayout: @/newPayout&br;Calculated Payout: @/calcPayout&br;totalPayout: @/totalPayout&br;halfPayout: @/halfPayout

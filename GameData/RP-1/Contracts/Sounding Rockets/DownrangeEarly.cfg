	description = <b>Program: Early Rocket Development<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The challenge of orbit is not merely to go high, which has been shown by breaching the Karman line, but to achieve great horizontal speed. Design, build, and launch a rocket that will travel 3000 km or more over ground. Such a rocket is typically two stages (guided lower stage coupled with an unguided upper stage), has 6 km/s or more of delta-v, and is using upgraded engines, tanks, and/or avionics. Do this, and you will be halfway to orbit! <b><color="white">Your rocket must be suborbital (over 140 km) for the contract to be completed. @RP0:avionics50sAdvice</color></b> Perfecting this is part of launch vehicle development to tune your ascent profile and develop high-altitude staging methods. The current distance that your rocket has traveled can be seen in the contract parameters in the Contracts App display for this contract. It will update in real time. &br;&br;<b><color="green">@RP0:f3BadAdvice</color></b>

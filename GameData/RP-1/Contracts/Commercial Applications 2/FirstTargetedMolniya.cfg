	description = <b>Program: Advanced Commercial Applications<br><b>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>A Molniya orbit is a type of highly elliptical orbit with an inclination of 63.4 degrees, an argument of perigee in the very high or low latitudes, and an orbital period of one half of a sidereal day. This causes it to spend most of its time over two areas on the ground at opposing longitudes. Place a commercial satellite into a Molniya orbit so that it loiters over the specified ground location for at least 6 consecutive hours.<br><br>Historical example: Molniya 1-1 (1,600kg, Molniya)<br><br><b><color=yellow>NOTE: The satellite will be destroyed upon completion of the contract. This simulates transfer of the payload back to the customer.</color>

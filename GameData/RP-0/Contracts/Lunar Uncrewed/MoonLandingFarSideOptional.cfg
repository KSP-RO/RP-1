	description = Design and successfully launch a craft that can achieve a soft landing on the far side of the Moon and return science data back to Earth.<br><br>Lunar libration already allows us to see 59% of the Moon's surface, so we want you to land within 80° of the far side.<br><br>The reward of this contract will slowly increase over time but will be reset to 0 after each completion.<br><b>Current reward is at @rewardFactorPercent % of its nominal value. Elapsed/Expected Days: @elapsedDays / @expectedDays</b><br><br>This is a series of @maxCompletions contracts, of which @index have been completed.
	genericDescription = Achieve a soft landing on the far side of the Moon and transmit Science.

	completedMessage = Mission Success! You have safely landed on the far side of the Moon and returned valuable science data from the surface. We now know that it is possible for a crewed craft to land there safely as well.

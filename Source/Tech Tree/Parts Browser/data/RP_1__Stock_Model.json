Historically, these were flown on V-2 Rockets.\\nThe photos cannot be transmitted and must be returned for further study. Level 1 Photograph Experiment. Can gather 20% of Photography Science. You can store up to 3 different photos before you need to return them to Earth.",

Ideal of analyzing the atmospheric composition of unknown environments. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Historically, these simple experiments were flown on interplanetary crafts including the Mars Viking Lander and Cassini.\\nLevel 4 Mass Spectrometry Experiment Device.

//**********************************************************************************
//Mariner 10 Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer
//mass: 5.5 kg [1]
//power consumption: 4.3 Watts [1]
//Occultation spectrometer with 0.15 degree FoV, capable of sampling from 47 to 89 nm, and airglow
//spectrometer with 0.13x3.6 degree FoV, capable of sampling from 20 to 170 nm. [1]
//21 seconds per spectrogram [2].
//Pretty simple instrument, just a few photon counters at the emission wavelength of molecules of interest.
//Occultation spectrometer measured atmospheric extinction at the limb of Mercury when Mariner 10 passed
//behind it, airglow spectrometer measured airglow on night side of Mercury. Actually needs darkness. [3]
//4 channels on occultation spectrometer, 12 channels on airglow spectrometer [2]
//16 channels total, guessing 12 bits per channel
//16*12 = 192 bits per spectrogram
//Only about 45 spectrograms taken per pass. Occultation Spectrograms taken during 10 minute period after
//closest approach, airglow spectrograms taken every few minutes in hours before and after closest approach
//192 bits * 45 spectrograms = 8,640 bits (0.00108 MB)
//Give duration of an hour, for 2.4 bit/s

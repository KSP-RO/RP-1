	description = <b>Program: Early Commercial Applications<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>Through measuring the Doppler shift of radio signals transmitted from a satellite in a known orbit, it is possible for a receiver on the ground to establish their location, which would have many applications both civilian and military. To test the principle and develop receiver equipment, it is necessary to have a test navigational satellite in orbit. <br>Historical example: Transit 1B (119 kg, Thor-Ablestar).

	synopsis = Launch the first navigation satellite

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The satellite is in orbit and we have already begun to receive Doppler curves.

	synopsis = Land a crew of three on the Moon for six months

	completedMessage = Congratulations! We have proved our long-duration, high-capacity lunar habitation designs. This work provides excellent insight into what it takes to live in space for a long time. Perhaps we can stretch it to twelve months?

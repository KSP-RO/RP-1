	description = <b>Program: Crewed Orbit<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Reentry is brutally hot and dangerous but it can be survivable with the right technology and equipment. We want you to design, build, and launch a craft that can survive a reentry and make a soft landing or splashdown on Earth after achieving a typical orbit (roughly 200 km). This is a step up in the testing to ensure that our equipment works under expected orbital mission parameters. Note that this contract will be unavailable after completing the first crewed orbit.
	genericDescription = Recover a craft from an typical crewed orbit descent.
	
	synopsis = Recover a craft from an typical crewed orbit descent

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The craft has survived reentry, and engineers are examining it very keenly indeed.

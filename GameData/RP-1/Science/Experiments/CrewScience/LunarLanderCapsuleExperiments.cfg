//Mass: 5kg
//Power consumption: 17.5W
//Frame size: 525 lines
//TV Lines: 350
//Field Scan Rate: 59.94 fields-per-second monochrome (Field-sequential colour system)
//Frames per second: 29.97
//TODO: Convert this to a data rate somehow.
//For now define the data size and rate such that at least an 1.5dBm internal S-band omni won't work. No way to prevent 3.0 dBm S-band omnis from working. They achieve the same data rate as S-Band dishes

{
	name = first_OrbitRecover
	title = Reach Orbital Speed & Return Safely to Earth
	group = CrewedOrbit
	agent = Federation Aeronautique Internationale

	description = Reentry is brutally hot and dangerous, but it can be survivable with the right technology and equipment. We want you to design, build, and launch a craft that can survive a reentry and make a soft landing or splashdown on Earth. Note that orbital-speed suborbital flights are acceptable as well. Historically this research started with weapon reentry vehicles for the newly developing ICBM forces but the research, and rockets, were quite applicable elsewhere; reconnaissance satellite recovery vessels, crewed capsules, and interplanetary landers have also withstood this crucible.&br;&br;You may complete this contract up to two times. Second completion will require getting into orbit with a minimum perigee of 200km.
	genericDescription = Recover a craft from an orbital-velocity descent

	synopsis = Recover a craft from an orbital-velocity descent

	completedMessage = Congratulations! The craft has survived reentry, and engineers are examining it very keenly indeed.

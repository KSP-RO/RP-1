	description = A Sun-synchronous orbit is a geocentric orbit that combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planet's surface at the same local solar time. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging, spy, and weather satellites.&br;&br;Place a satellite into a Sun-synchronous orbit. Note that sun-synchronous orbits are often slightly retrograde as is this orbit. From the launch pad, be sure to fly northwest so it will take more Delta-v than a normal polar orbit.

	synopsis = Launch a satellite into a Sun-synchronous orbit

	completedMessage = Success! True sun-synchronous orbits are not possible in KSP due to the equatorial bulge not being present. However, this is similar to what these orbits are.

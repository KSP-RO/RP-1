	description = Create a satellite that can provide high resolution SAR mapping of @/targetBodyValid1. For best results, the orbit should have a high inclination to cover all surface area of the planetary body. Be sure to look at the information available for each scanner to determine the best altitude to scan.
	
	genericDescription = Perform a High Resolution survey of the targeted celestial body.

	synopsis = Perform a High Resolution survey of @/targetBodyValid1.

	completedMessage = Mission Success! This mapping survey will be very valuable to the scientists on Earth looking to learn more about the surface of the planet. The increased fidelity from the SAR mapping will unlock many more details about the planet.
